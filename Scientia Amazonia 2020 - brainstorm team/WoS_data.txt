AB The Romanian science education reform is targeting a real literacy in science and technology among all graduates of the compulsory education. Writing, talking, and reading about science are desirable goals of scientific literacy, and also ways of achieving it. One the one hand, the current generation of pupils is a digital one, a YouTube Generation or Net Generation, Which has grown up in an environment in which it is constantly exposed to digital technology and accustomed to the use of various media, short written texts, pictures and videos, for pleasure and sometimes for learning. On the other hand, hands-on learning activities based on ICT tools aim at increasing pupils' interest in sciences both during formal and non-formal education. In this context, the use of visuals and ICT, in particular, of digital comics, can be a suitable medium/method for science education and communication for this young generation. In this article, we describe and analyze how ICT-based formal and non-formal activities incorporating digital comics and other visuals can facilitate learning and can increase student enthusiasm/motivation for learning science. This article presents and analyzes example activities designed for secondary school pupils by students from the Faculty of Physics, from the West University of Timisoara, which are also enrolled in the preservice teacher training program offered by this institution. The favorable feedback we have received from the pupils and preservice science teachers alike leads us to assert that such innovative ICT-based teaching methods can lead to a revival of the Romanian science education in general, and of the Romanian physics education in particular, at least as a result of raising pupils' interest in this discipline.

AB This study aimed to understand teachers' classroom practices using computer-based simulations (CBS) when teaching electrolysis. The study was framed by the Consensus Model of Pedagogical Content Knowledge. Convenience and purposive sampling were used to select three experienced chemistry teachers from three schools in Eswatini (Swaziland). Semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and classroom observations were used in the data collection. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis in terms of six emergent themes. The findings of this study reveal how the teachers' views and knowledge about CBS and electrolysis relate to the way they integrate CBS into their lessons while teaching this topic. The teachers all believed that CBS enhances learners' understanding of electrolysis because it enables learners to visualise abstract processes, and because the simulations raise learners' interest and enhance critical thinking. Two of the teachers valued learners' involvement in the manipulation of the CBS, while the remaining teacher believed that it was adequate for learners to 'see' the movement of ions and electrons. During classroom discussions following the simulations, the teachers sometimes displayed poor content knowledge, thus reducing the value of the learning experience. All of the teachers were concerned that the shortage of equipment, large class sizes and the poor socio-economic background of the learners may affect the effective use of CBS. Although the schools participating in this study had computers, they were reserved for use by the ICT departments, adding to the obstacles faced by the teachers. It is recommended that teachers are made familiar with the pedagogy of using CBS, and that teachers' content knowledge should be prioritised during their training to enhance the effective use of CBS.

AB Virtual Reality is an emerging educational technology due to its potential immersive, interactive and imaginative characteristics supporting pupils in the learning process towards meaningful learning. Furthermore, the current teaching of history is generally too traditional, making the subject being perceived as pointless and boring by students. These aspects lead to poor academic performance. In this context, this study focuses on analysing the eventual benefits of Virtual Reality in the teaching of history at Primary Education and compares its results with those of traditional teaching resources in two dimensions, academic performance and the motivation of students. Thus, an intervention was performed with 98 fourth graders divided into two groups, control and experimental. For the collection of the data referring to motivation, an adaptation of the Instructional Material Survey instrument from Keller [(2010). Motivational design for learning and performance: The ARCS model approach. New York, NY: Springer] was used while, in relation to the evaluation of the academic performance, a specific test was designed taking as reference the tests of the coursebooks for the unit of work ?The Roman Civilization? of the subject Social Sciences. The results show statistically significant differences in favour of those students who used Virtual Reality, both in motivation and in academic performance.

AB Although in Accra Technical University (ATU), Ghana, there exists a traditional Face-to-Face (F2F) mode of education already in place, the implementation of electronic learning (e-learning) through ICT in education will increase the number of students admitted yearly. Lack of academic facilities makes e-learning an attractive alternative. Consequently, this article employed a questionnaire as a research instrument with reference to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM-2) as a theoretical framework. In all, questionnaires were administered to 190 students and 14 lecturers in the Faculty of Applied Sciences in Accra Technical University (ATU). Based on the responses received, various types of e-learning systems were exploited and a SWOT (Strength Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats) analysis was conducted to validate the sustainability of proposing and developing a suitable e-learning system for ATU. It is envisaged that successful implementation of the e-learning system proposed in this article will practically increase the use of ICT in education by both lecturers and students in ATU.

AB Technology is entwined in 21st Century society, and within the lives of people across all ages. The Technology In Later Life (TILL) study is the first piece of work contributing to the impact, behavior, and perception of technology use, by adults aged >= 70 years, residing in rural and suburban areas. TILL is an international, multi-centred, multi-methods study investigating and conceptualizing how various technologies impact the lives of older adults; residing in urban and rural locations in the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. This in-depth study recruited 37 participants via a multi-methods approach. Analysis of the findings ascertained two overarching themes: facilitators of technology use (i.e., sharing of information and feeling secure), and detractors of technology (i.e., feelings of apprehension of use). Proposed recommendations include promotion of technology from a strengths-based perspective focusing on positive opportunities technology to improve health and wellbeing, creating a peer support network to assist with learning of new technology, and the need to examine further how intergenerational relationships may be enhanced through the use of technology. The distinction of these themes narrates to the originality of this initial study and milieu of recruited participants, intersecting across the fields of gerontology, geography, social sciences, and gerontechnology.

AB Multilingual skills tend to be an integral part of modern society because a specialist able to speak, read and write in multi-languages is able to meet competition. Given that all the latest discoveries and achievements in the field of natural science have been published in English, in accordance with the theme of our study, Physics teaching in English becomes one of the topical issues. However, experience has proven that a few students realize the importance of language integrated learning (LIL) that was confirmed by statistical data from questionnaire made among students of specialties 5B060400 and 5B011000-Physics, the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Akhmet Yassawi International Kazakh-Turkish University. Realizing the value of gained knowledge is directly related to the motivation and result of learning process. It is assumed that the solution to this problem lies in the competitive organization of language integrated learning in teaching namely in appropriate choice of teaching methods. This is valuable in the context of modern practice-oriented understanding of learning. These technologies include the ICT and case study method which help to change the students' meaning of how the foreign language important from the point of view of their proficiency that was confirmed by statistical data. Some methodological aspects of the use of ICT and case-study in language integrated teaching as well as mechanisms of interdisciplinary coordination and cooperation between English teachers and Physics teachers that both contributed to the ICT and case-study integration in language integrated teaching as well as it is valuable for further research in this area. The staff of the Chair of Physics at the Akhmet Yassawi International Kazakh-Turkish University creates close ties worldwide and conducts extensive work in this direction. The theoretical and experimental studies that were carried out convincingly prove the need introduce into the educational process an innovative methods in the educational process as a case study and ICT for the formation of creativity of University students.

AB Tools for online collaboration are becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years. Certain characteristics of these tools encourage this proliferation: they are easy to use, always available, allow knowledge to be built collaboratively and disseminated quickly through social networks, and are usually free of charge. In this context, blogs are becoming increasingly important in the field of health as digital newspapers and magazines that support a large number of multimedia formats. The possibility to subscribe to blogs and their availability in formats adaptable to mobile devices mean their content can be taken anywhere. Although the use of blogs is well-established among Health Science professionals, their use among university professors as a component of the teaching strategies in these disciplines is much less common, and thus the benefits, risks and limitations of using blogging as a pedagogical tool are poorly understood. In this preliminary evaluation of a pedagogy, a public WordPress-based blog was developed for the Nutrition and Dietetics module of the undergraduate course in Nursing at the University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). This was primarily intended as way to use ICT to increase the level of student engagement and interest in learning the subject, but also as a way to introduce future health professionals to the world of blogging. This paper describes our experiences with this pedagogical project and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the use of blogs in university Health Sciences teaching. Incorporating this tool into teaching methodologies takes advantages of the theoretical possibilities it offers, which include crucial aspects such as developing critical thinking, acquiring knowledge, answering questions from students, and enabling new mechanisms to develop the skills that must be acquired. However, the challenges and inconveniences are also highlighted; these are principally the lack of motivation and the low participation of the students. By analysing the outcomes of this preliminary evaluation of a pedagogy, it is concluded that blogs are a very useful tool, although it is suggested that the literature shows a certain bias toward the publication of successful trials.

AB Today's fast-changing World imposes new challenges in all aspects of our lives. Most prominent changes have been observed in information and communications technology (ICT). These changes imposed new challenges for the education system, schools, and especially for teachers. Keeping up with the pace of these developments has gained an increased popularity in today's digital culture, and in consequence academic interest increased significantly on using smart and modern technologies in the field of Physical Education. So far a reasonable amount of research has been done to study technology integration in teaching and learning environments. Yet, more effort needs to be spent for the claims and research within the realm of Physical Education. This paper therefore tries to present a short overview on the topic, the approaches, tools and studies about the use of technology in the field of PE.

AB Students today are increasingly engaged in the use of digital information and communication technologies. The Internet continues to grow and more and more young people are using it worldwide. Educational practices, however, have been slow to adapt to the corresponding developments. For example, Internet forums are generally ignored in most educational practices, including chemistry education, although they are often used to find new information by everyday people. The question therefore arises: Why are such media not used to provoke and promote science or chemistry teaching and learning, while simultaneously developing critical scientific media literacy? To understand how the younger generation learns via Internet forums, this article looks at a survey of Internet forum usage behavior by lower and upper secondary school students (age range 12-17) in relation to chemistry-specific content. The findings are then contrasted with an analysis of user behavior. The final analysis revealed that students are open and critical when using Internet forums, even though such learning is mostly unconnected to formal education. These results can inform science and chemistry teaching by focusing teaching and learning more on Internet forums in order to employ them as an educational medium in science class.

AB Many researchers have dealt previously with visual literacy in the context of new media and the use of images. The goal of this manuscript is to present a systematic review of the literature to identify, analyze and classify the published approaches and by this way find, give support or improve different research works which are carried out under the perspective of the new technologies. As results, this study identified 39 papers that link the visual literacy with the new technologies, or the images used in social networks. There have been found different main approaches where are related to the new media with visual literacy in education, with ICTs, art and design, communication, psychology, demography, professional aspects or information sciences. However, those approaches lacked standardization and were mainly ad-hoc solutions for each presented research scenario. The primary field of research where this concept is used is the use of images in education. In this field, the authors try to demonstrate how daily images can be related to formal learning. Some of the outcomes and solutions found in the literature (albeit not much frequent) conclude that thanks to some ad-hoc tools designed for each experiment, the researchers can achieve the goal of observing the status of visual literacy in users of new technologies and new media. Despite that several research efforts work in this subject and its challenges, the research community needs to continue improving the research in this area through the application of new techniques and methods which can lead to achieving standardized solutions. Moreover, thus, let researchers explore new ways of analyzing and interpreting the visual literacy avoiding custom solutions or evaluating well-known proposals from the literature.

AB The digital tools are promissory to the teaching chemistry at the high school and undergraduate levels because we believe that by implanting these technologies are produced a better teaching-learning. However, it is known that digital tools are often not used in the school and university routine due to the lack of knowledge by teachers, as well by the lack of support offered by the educational institutions. In this context, this work envisions to present information and communication technologies (ICTs), both in a specific and generalized approach, which can be used for teaching Chemistry. This may contribute to improve the formation and thereby provide better teachers. It was carried out a bibliographic survey by using national and international journal sources. Thirty-seven papers are selected for the elaboration of this study. The results showed that by applying the ICTs can help the understanding of contents proposed in classrooms. Furthermore, the ICTs instigate the students, generating better participation and interest, making a more comfortable and dynamic environment for a better teaching-learning. In this facet, it is interesting that teachers use such technologies to promote meaningful, diversified, and evolutionary learning.

AB Pedagogical innovation involving smartphone technology may offer teachers the opportunity to create an environment of engaging learning in laboratories. In this paper, we outline how to use Socrative Student Response by Mastery Connect, a variation of a real-time audience response system. We hypothesized that using this application as an audience response system can enhance learning and identify student knowledge gaps in chemistry laboratory classes. In order to explore the relationships among factors and the educational effectiveness of Socrative, data from a graduate-level chemistry course students were investigated. Before and after laboratory classes, experimental subjects completed an audience response system quiz using Socrative application in their mobile devices. Students felt that the method enhanced their learning process whereas teachers reported that it improved academic performance and the relationships between teachers and students. Socrative can be considered as a powerful tool to dynamize and evaluate chemistry laboratory practices.

AB This study, based on the theory of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge investigated the effectiveness of introducing open source YouTube videos in the teaching and learning of the Chemistry topic 'Group Properties' at a high school in Lesotho. A quasi-experimental design was used for two conveniently selected Form D classes; one class used as the experimental group ( n = 49) and the other as a control group ( n = 60). The questions in the pre-test and the similar post-test were formulated to establish the learners' cognitive abilities in line with various levels of Bloom's Cognitive Domain. The mean performance of the two groups before the intervention was not statistically different. After introducing the experimental group to YouTube videos the performance of the group was significantly better than that of the control group during the post-test. The performance of the experimental group was also significantly better than that of the control group at the higher cognitive levels of Bloom's Cognitive Domain, namely, at application to evaluation. The incorporation of videos in teaching Chemistry provided a better option than the traditional method of science teaching. The use of the YouTube videos resulted in a doubling of the percentage of the experimental group learners passing the post-test (from 12 to 27%), while the percentage of control group learners passing the tests remained constant at 5% for both the pre-test and the post-test. In light of the significant benefits of using YouTube videos in this context of poor laboratory resources, it is recommended that teachers should be trained to integrate technology in their teaching in order to supplement practical work.

ID MODEL
AB The Universidad Catolica de Temuco (Araucania region, Chile) has experienced substantial changes in recent years: today, young people with a poor academic background, who are also digital natives, are enrolled in it. In this scenario, fostering deep learning in all students, the teachers have been given the task of implementing active learning methodologies with ICT incorporation. Specifically, the faculty that teaches "Chemistry in Context" to engineering students decided to transform (re-design) of this course, which included the implementation of active learning strategies such as the flipped classroom, instead of traditional lectures, and guided inquiry to change the laboratory work. This article explains how the new strategies were implemented, and it shows results which were obtained by contrasting students' performance (based on the grades) before and after the transformation process. After the transformation, the approval rate nearly doubled and the dropout rate reduced from 40% to 17% in 2017. In the case of the laboratory work, although the tasks were more complex guided inquiry showed much better grades. These results can be attributed to the students working to build their learning, to the fact that the laboratory grade had a more significant percentage of the final grade and to the fact that students had to do all the experimental work as a mandatory activity otherwise they would fail the course. It was found that the flipped classroom will be successful if students value autonomous work and act accordingly.

AB RUDN University is the most multinational and internationally focused University of Russia. Every year students from more than 145 countries of the world enjoy this University to study and get a degree. Their life and studies in Russia may be really challenging for them due to a number of issues that certainly influence the level of their achievements and quality of the gained educational skills. It's very important to create comfortable and friendly atmosphere for foreign students studying in Russia because it increases the rating of Russian education abroad. In this article you will find analysis of the academic progress of both Russian and Foreign students, the analysis is based on 3 graphic disciplines: descriptive geometry, engineering graphics and computer graphics. We have consolidated a practical experience of teaching foreign students graphic subjects that involved using of information and communicative technologies in the University of Technical Sciences. The Influence of such factors as integration of descriptive geometry and computer graphics courses, implementation of the telecommunication learning resource system developed on the Moodle platform, the use of control system with tests and "cloud" technologies of AutoCAD A360 on increasing quality of the educational process organization is identified. The training function of this testing system is accurately examined. We have also enlightened the role of mobile versions of information and communication technologies for self-studying process organization.

AB The freshmen at the UNNE School of Engineering have difficulty in writing chemical equations for its relationship with previous knowledge about formulation and nomenclature that students find hard to internalize. This determines the low performance in the assessment of the subject. In the view of the interest of our students in technology, explanatory video clips of our own production were incorporated in support of classroom lectures. We explored the effect of the video clips on learning. Presented are the results and the analysis of answers of the chemical equations exercises of cohorts of 2015, 2016 and 2017, with use of video clips, and they are contrasted with cohort 2014 of traditional teaching. The use of video clips favors significant learning of the subject "chemical equations".

AB Active learning is a format alternative to the conventional lecture/recitation/laboratory; research results have reported that it is suitable to encourage student inquiry and foster peer mentoring. Although the availability of computer-based learning materials in biomedical sciences is increasing, there are relatively few studies aimed to integrate traditional methods of teaching with inquiry-based approaches utilizing these Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools. This paper describes a pilot-study on a comprehensive active laboratory course about digital ophthalmologic signal classification, experienced by a group of undergraduates in Bio-Electronic Engineering. During the activity, the students became able to discriminate healthy subjects from patients affected by two retinal pathologies: Achromatopsia or Congenital Stationary Night Blindness. The study was based on the analysis and classification of the electroretinograms, that record the retinal response to a light flash. To process electroretinographic data, a software based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition and an Artificial Neural Network was used. Our findings indicate that this laboratory experience can be considered effective in improving student's reasoning skills and that students acting as investigators achieve a better outcome, presumably because this activity satisfies their psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

AB The study was a cross-sectional exploratory survey to determine lecturers' and students' use of the core e-learning site, e-Thuto, at the Central University of Technology, Free State (CUT). The goal was to determine the adoption of electronic learning via information and communication technologies (ICTs) towards the improvement of the quality of teaching and learning. Yet, research cites several resource and skills challenges hindering ICT adoption in teaching and learning in developing economies that remain unaddressed. Data were collected from 10 lecturers in the Department of Communication Sciences at the CUT and 90 undergraduate students from all the four CUT faculties in order to correlate lecturers' and students' perspectives. Therefore, a structured interview schedule was used. Data were analysed using the emic and etic approaches where the respondents' categorisation of behaviour, correlated with conceptual categories from literature, was regarded as the reality in the study context. The findings indicate a limited adoption of e-Thuto in teaching and learning due to several impediments. The policy implications point towards a more systematic integration of ICTs into the curriculum.

We analysed the years, journals, conceptual background, research methodologies, data collection tools, professional disciplines, educational contexts, types of social media and characteristics of social media that can generate learning opportunities. A total of 44 articles were selected and analysed from peer-reviewed journals. Findings revealed that (1) an upward trend with respect to research on social media and professional development; (2) surveys were the main research method for collecting data about social media; (3) health and education sciences are the most studied fields of knowledge; (4) there is a special interest in the study of social media in informal learning contexts; (5) Twitter is the most studied social media platform and (6) social media seems to be a sustainable support for professional development due to its open, social and flexible nature. Implications of findings for future research are also discussed.

AB Contemporary engineering education is based on the integrating role of individual expert which is why the present day fundamental goal of higher professional education is to achieve a rounded personality development and ensure continual enhancement of their professional competence (PC). The paper presents a theoretically formulated model for development and growth of PC in students of technical universities that is consistent with the goals and tasks of the process under research. It also presents a description of the model's components which are organized in five separate blocks: purpose, functional, contents, organizational, and diagnostic-assessment. The paper recommends examples for interdisciplinary integration for different subjects (between subjects from humanitarian sciences and technical sciences, interdisciplinary laboratory exercises by using ICT, seminary exercises in the subjects "Physics", "Mathematics" and special learning disciplines etc.)

AB The phenomenon of growth of the elderly population associated with information and communication sciences and technologies has inspired several research projects that seek alternatives to include this part of the population to this new reality. From the bibliographical survey on the state of the art, most of the studies considered the variables gender, physical situation, digital inclusion and socialization of the elderly. A study appended [20] considered the variables gaming narrative, social interaction and health condition as direct predictors of intention to use digital games, proposing a model of use and acceptance of the extended technologies. In this context, and in view of this identified gap, this research proposal seeks to identify characteristics that facilitate and / or promote the acceptance of electronic games, their use and the learning of information and communication technologies by the elderly population. These characteristics will be used as variables to be incorporated into the TAM-TPB model [19].

ID STRATEGY; JUDOKA; LEVEL
AB Background. Since 2006, the Faculty of Sport Sciences of Montpellier students must build 4 specific applications with general and specific software, in order to train them in the use of sportive video analysis,. These ICT skills are part of those defined by the Ministry of Higher Education, and the feature of these applications is the use of "delayed videos" analysis. Students' learning journey is supported by online tutorials. To consider the ever-increasing efficiency of new technologies and go further in video analysis, we have added a step (a fifth application): the use of "live videos" analysis excluding the backtracking of video. The benefits of this type of work can help decision-making in everyday life and therefore concern the world of sport.
   Problem. The purpose of this work was to observe students analyzing a recorded video sequence excluding video backtracking, as if it were live, as a coach. The feasibility conditions of such an experiment led us to study a judo combat by appreciating or estimating the interactions between different criteria as a coach.
   Method. After training, Masters students (n=12), who specialized in video analysis and in judo performance, analyzed (they studied the same bout three times) the balance of power (subjective criterion) between two judokas. The process required the student observers to identify whether a judoka was "dominant, i.e.: in a favorable position to win" or "dominated" whilst managing his/ her actions in "programmed/conscious" or "automatic, i.e.: reflex organization" modes. Nonparametric Kolmogorov Smirnov and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze the data collected by the students.
   Conclusions. These tests indicated that the analyses were identical and stable at the intra-observer (p= [0.095: 0.999], p= [0.219: 1.0]) and group levels (p=0.224; p=0.406). We propose to include this methodology of analysis in Masters' students training programs and develop these live analyses for coaches, teachers or referees.

AB Information and communication technology (ICT) plays an important role in our daily activities. ICT can have positive and negative impacts on organizations, people and society. Rapid access to information, improved access to education, new job opportunities, new tools etc. may be mentioned as a positive impact of ICT on people, but the decrease in personal interaction and the decline in physical activity may be mentioned as negative aspects of ICT. Also, the impact of ICT on society is both positive, such as improved communication across the world, increasing educational opportunities, and negative, such as the digital divide between those who have access to information and who cannot have, as well as the availability of a large number of incorrect and misleading information. Students spend a lot of their time using the ICT or the Internet facilities. The objectives of the study are: i) to explore how and how much of their time students spend by using ICT; ii) to find out the relationship between students' use of ICT for an academic and non-academic purpose and their performance; iii) to identify which educational software students know and use. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, more than 150 second-year students of the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies were surveyed. The first part of the questionnaire focused on students' time distribution per week. The results of the study show that the students of LLU spend using ITC for more than 25 % of the time per week, about 30 % of the time is devoted to sleeping and rest, about 20 %-to learning. The second part of the questionnaire focused on exploring how much time students spend for academic, non-academic and social use of ICT. The results show that about 63 % of the time spent on the Internet is used for non-academic purposes. The third part of the questionnaire provided information on students' knowledge, skills and habits to use different educational software. The study suggests that proper steps should be taken by the academic or related institutions to promote the use of ICT for focusing on academic purposes, so that the students may benefit more from using ICT.

AB In many European universities, access to biology studies is non-selective and implies the enrolment of several hundred students who graduated from high school with a generally weak life sciences background. Teachers from the Biology Department of the University of Lille (France) are currently involved in a student-centred didactical project aimed to improve the attractiveness of animal biology using innovative e-learning tools. Members of younger generations are mostly used to visual approaches in learning, sometimes in contrast with the "traditional" educational methods. This is why the use of multimedia supports, available on different devices, can increase motivation and promote individual involvement in learning. We produced movies and interactive e-books describing the body plan and anatomy of organisms representative of the main Metazoan phyla. These free-access tools are used by students to prepare and review practical sessions. The learning outcomes include: (i) the visualisation of the dissection steps (technical know-how), (ii) identification of the main organs and understanding their relationships (memorisation), and finally (iii) the success of the evaluation (learning feedback). The integration of such multimedia tools, either in laboratory work or in lectures, contributes to an innovative approach in zoology teaching. The use of these information and communication technologies for education (ICTEs) has to be considered an original and useful means for helping learning, but it does not constitute a complete solution. This approach must be complemented with a solid and regular inductive instruction in the discipline.

AB Metacognition is one of the skills in the 21st century learning and defined as someone awareness of their own knowledge and regulation of their own thinking. Metacognition is needed in chemistry learning and everyday life to understand matter and solve problems. Learners need to know their own metacognition in order to improve and develop their metacognitive. This paper aimed to prescribe metacognition indicators that used in the instrument and modelling a proper testlet instrument in blended learning design to assess students' metacognition in the Environmental Chemistry course. This instrument is in e-learning website to support blended learning and the application of ICT in the 21st century learning. Participants in this study were 9 experts who tested the validity of metacognition indicators and the validity of the instrument. The Delphi technique and Aiken's Formula with 9 experts used to measure the content validity. The results were: (1) Metacognition indicators measured were declarative knowledge, conditional knowledge, procedural knowledge, planning, and evaluation; (2) The instrument validity test results showed that each item was valid and matching with the metacognition indicators. Based on the results, the valid testlet instrument can be used to measure students' metacognition level.

The challenge for educational institutions is to deal with this broad spectrum. Departments and institution with different specialization are required to work more closely with each other to be able to teach the topic of Industry 4.0 in all its dimensions. One of the approaches of the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer is to build a platform, where different departments can work on, collaborate and use it to teach the various aspects of Industry 4.0. This platform is called the "Automated Class Room" and is a physical demonstrator, which consists of many different modules from different departments, such as mechatronic machines, simulation tools, management tools, logistics systems which are integrated into an Industry 4.0 compliant ICT (information-communication technologies) architecture. This paper provides an overview about the platform and discusses in depth how it is currently used for teaching Industry 4.0 to different target audiences. It describes in which parts the individual departments and specific courses set their focus and how they can demonstrate the benefits of Industry 4.0 for students but also for visitors of the university and enterprises. Furthermore, the "Automated Class Room" is used as a practical test bed, where students from different departments can learn together how to implement Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies. The paper also gives an overview about how the platform is going to evolve in the future. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB For more than three decades different initiatives in educational policies have been carried out, being their main purpose to reduce inequalities and to improve the quality education through the integration of ICTs. Said public policies, connected to the incorporation of technology in the pedagogical practices, have been established as valuable opportunities to enrich teaching proposals in current society from different approaches and strategies. The one-to-one learning model, the mobile learning and the computer sciences have been emerging topics in the field of digital policies. However, at present, the situation is not bridged. The democratisation of the access to the ICTs by wide sectors of school population is still pending and in this regard the countries of Latin America are addressed. In particular, it is acknowledged the need to revise the ICTs initiatives in the education field and to put in prospective value the digital policies to bring about deep changes which will contribute to better learning and thus cover pending debts in the context of the Education Agenda 2030. This document presents the main challenges and the future perspectives which have to be addressed urgently to continue and strengthen the integration of the 1CTs in the education systems of Latin America.

DE Quantitative techniques; teaching innovation; university professors;
   virtual classroom
AB The change of the paradigm entailed in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has without question represented an improvement in the educational process. We consider that university teachers currently organize learning environments which involve their students. In the context of the EHEA, the evaluation system is designed to get to know the students' acquirement of knowledge and competences. In this framework, we consider that the students' tutored and self-directed learning favors their acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue their university studies and their professional and life project.
   However, this change has also highlighted a series of problems which appear in the university environment in the EHEA. This work presents the results of the implementation of a series of innovations proposed with the aim of improving students' academic performance, reducing the drop-out rate, acquiring group work skills, and showing students the advantages of computer tools and virtual environments.
   To do so, the research has been carried out over five academic years, compiling information via surveys and interviews of the students in a subject, which is taught in the 2nd. year of Degree of Political Sciences and Administration at the Pablo de Olavide University (Seville, Spain): "Quantitative Methods applied to Social Sciences". Being a quantitative subject that is taught in the area of Social Sciences means that from the start the students in general reject it a priori. To avoid this leading to the students dropping out or not passing the subject, we put into practice a teaching model based on the students' continuous evaluation. The teaching model means that 50% of the time is dedicated to theoretical classes and 50% to practical classes (which take place in smaller-sized classrooms or in computer labs). In the case of the theoretical classes, the students are evaluated at the end of the semester by a written examination. The practical classes are assessed using three individual tests during the semester and a weekly individual follow-up work.
   After introducing the methodological and evaluating innovations, we have achieved an increase in the number of students who pass the subject, a reduction in the drop-out rate and a better use of Information and Communication Technologies. Although this has meant a greater workload for the teaching team and the students, the skills which we have worked on have had a satisfactory short-term result. At the same time, we consider that this experience can be applied to any subject studied in the university area.

AB The use of ICT and mass media has become one of the main lines of research for the teaching-learning process and educational innovation. The aim of this paper is to learn the opinion of future teachers of Social Sciences in Spain and England on the use of different resources for the teaching of History in Secondary Education. To this end, non-experimental quantitative research was carried out through a questionnaire with a closed Likert rating scale (1-5) in 22 universities in Spain and England with a broad territorial representation, and with a sample of 504 questionnaires. The descriptive results of one of the items of the questionnaire related to the objective of this work have been detailed, and a description of some of the factors has been made through the analysis of principal components with Varimax rotation. The data extracted shows some significant differences between the future Spanish and English teachers regarding the use of ICT and mass media. Some differences show a more motivational perception of the use of these resources in the Spanish case, which is more procedural in England. It is necessary to improve teacher training in Spain, both initial and permanent, in order to achieve more dynamic History classes through the use of ICT and mass media as resources that allow the work of the historian to be replicated in class, to improve experiential activities in the historical formation of the students, and not merely as a playful element.

AB The inverted class or Flipped Classroom teaching methodology that proposes that the work of certain learning processes be transferred out of the classroom, that is to say that the students prepare the subjects outside the alma mater, through the use of information and communication technologies (TIC) and uses time in the classroom to carry out activities that require greater participation and student - teacher interaction, to debate ideas and development of constructs and mindfacts appropriate to generational change, management that is sustained with the support of new technologies; In conclusion, the method under study reverses the activities that are normally done in classes, with the activities that are done at home, that is, the technique proposes a change of paradigm more adjusted to the current realities of teaching. In order to demonstrate the potential of the Inverted Class proposal, the professors participating in this research reviewed in depth the results achieved with the application of this technique within the subject Capital Market pertaining to the degree of Business Administration and the financial area specifically to compare the results; To obtain the corresponding metrics, a perception measurement was displayed to students of two cohorts for the year 2017, distributed in 4 rooms per semester, and an average of 25 students per class, for a total of 212 students participating in the methodology belonging to the schools of economic and accounting administrative sciences of the private Universities of the region, where the technique object of study was applied and orienting others under the traditional system of education. This was elaborated in light of the case research approach, abstracting the results through the use of qualitative and quantitative methods, obtaining empirical evidence in the significant improvement of the students in terms of results and appropriation of competences, with an increase in the participation of students, and a strong orientation with discipline to the management of tasks and the research component, through interaction with technological tools placed at the service of pedagogy.

AB In order to contribute to the successful integration of ICTE (Information and Communication Technologies for Education) in higher education in Morocco, a pilot experiment was carried out among university students (Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Hassan II University Casablanca). In this article, we assume that the integration of ICTE is justified as shown by the multidimensional analysis adopted in the treatment of informant's responses. Thus, through an observation and application analysis of the chi-square law statistical test, we aim to consider the dependency relationships between the various modalities in the questionnaires and the various ways of monitoring the MOOC. The analysis of the results of this experiment has led to four main dimensions: teacher coaching, collaboration between learners, prerequisites in the module element and the rate of MOOC follow-up. These dimensions represent the most important factors for the integration of ICTE from a student's point of view.

AB This article presents the design and application of a teacher training workshop for science university professors based on the Model 5E in combination with the use of digital tools. The purpose is to develop the skills to design and implement strategies and didactic resources that enable the integration of the model and Information and Communication Technologies that allows the science teacher to innovate in the classroom. The workshop consists of three sessions where the steps are reviewed to engage, explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate through activities that have a participatory approach and where much of the collaborative work is encouraged. The workshop was held at the University Center of Biological and Agricultural Sciences of the University of Guadalajara where 14 teachers from the area of cell biology participated. The response to the workshop by the participants was satisfactory as it allowed them to reflect on their practice, to have greater openness and to lose the fear of using technologies, as well as consider the 5E model as a very important strategy for its students to achieve meaningful learning.

ID STUDENTS LEARN; PROGRAM
AB Molecular symmetry plays a central role in chemistry education with regard to predicting chemical properties such as bonding and spectroscopic transitions. Better understanding of the symmetry of molecules requires high visual-spatial thinking ability. Conventional teaching methodologies, with limited teaching aides, fall short in providing a detailed understanding of scientific theories and related concepts. Incorrect understanding has been known to perpetrate concepts that are not consistent with the consensus of the research community or alternate conceptions. This work elaborates a methodology designed to discover the alternate conceptions stemming from teaching molecular symmetry in a typical classroom environment and the impact of the virtual laboratory (VL) environment in correcting these misconceptions. Three significant contributions presented in this paper include: (1) the development of a media and information-intense VL experiment platform designed to enhance understanding of symmetry elements and point groups of molecules with diverse structural geometries. (2) the development of an instrument, Molecular symmetry Alternate Conception Test (MACT), designed to capture and estimate the extent of alternate conceptions. (3) the successful identification of typical alternate conceptions amongst students in the context of molecular symmetry. In addition to perceived alternate concepts in symmetry education, the results indicate a significant statistical improvement of 156% in understanding of molecular symmetry concepts (p < 0.05) after subjecting students to the interactive VL platform. This study also shows identifying bond angles and planarity as concepts crucial for students. It is also implicit that estimations of discrimination skills related to identifying concept-based learning may be relevant for perceiving alternate concepts among learners.

AB The new European training model has led to innovations in Higher Education as the incorporation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to learning processes. Each student learns in a different way and therefore the ways of studying are very relevant in the academic development. This fact has revealed the need for the use of ICT in the university environment. It has been a quantitative research using the questionnaire REATIC using a sample (N = 2117) of students from the five areas of knowledge at the University of Salamanca, to know the use and opinion they have about ICT in their learning. The results presented students management above all basic and personal interrelation programs, search engines in the network, online video portals and virtual libraries. They value the help and importance of ICT in their learning process and consider positively them as relevant tools. The results showed significant differences in the use and consideration of ICT in the five areas of knowledge. Health Sciences students present the highest preference level in use of ICT. Four well-differentiated clusters were identified by applying the factor analysis to obtain a multivariate characterization of the students: One was formed by students with a medium-low level of ICT consideration and use, another by the graduates with a high level of ICT consideration and use, to a third consisting of students with a medium-high level of ICT consideration and use and to final covering students with low level of ICT consideration and medium-low level of ICT use.

AB In the teaching of scientific and technological disciplines, the realization of experimental works with laboratories and real plants is crucial to strengthen the theoretical concepts acquired in the classroom. However, because of the lack of availability of real laboratories in some cases, or the lack thereof in the blended and distance education, a series of gaps in their learning have been imposed. Nevertheless, the development of ICTs has been a very important advance, since they can be used as a tool to "catalyze" access to these experimental tasks. In addition, it is of great importance that both students and society in general learn to work promoting sustainable development. The teaching of Green Chemistry and Engineering must be implemented so that society learns to care for the environment and human health.

AB The change from teacher-centered to student-centered learning- and teaching approaches that has been going on for decades as well as classroom heterogeneity have enhanced the importance of personalized learning-and teaching (P-learning) and learner autonomy.
   At the University of Applied Sciences Burgenland (UASB) in Eisenstadt, Self-Directed Learning (SDL) has been used and refined in the English classes of the business-related Master study programs for some years. It offers the students an autonomous approach to language learning by providing them the opportunity to define individual learning goals and choose individual learning tools to reach them. Students independently work on their SDL-project in their self-study time and realize it mainly by using online materials and specific online language-learning tools and/or apps. ICT enables students to access and use relevant teaching materials independent of time and place while at the same time it enables their teachers to monitor and give feedback at their convenience.
   Self-Directed Learning, together with personalized feedback for the learners, are used to ensure that through partial degrees of freedom regarding place, time and content of the course, students can work on individual learning goals and, consequently, remain highly motivated.

DE Thematic; modules; integrated learning; ICT
AB The demand for innovative language learning and teaching across the globe is at the forefront of trends in education and dominates academic discussions. The application and impact of Information Communication Technology (ICT) significantly contributes to curriculum development changes at public schools and universities as they reassess their goals and reinvigorate the curriculum related to content knowledge and language learning. The development of thematic learning modules encourages students to acquire knowledge and make connections through a common theme drawing from real world experiences. By integrating content and engaging students simultaneously in literacy and language learning, students are able to explore and expand their knowledge through creative resources. This presentation/publication focuses on constructing a framework for thematic learning modules that addresses course redesign incorporating essential content and ICT. Language learning is achieved along with conceptual understanding as students engage in the instruction and activities. Unit and lesson design as well as pedagogical input accompanying the learning activities is strengthened through meaningful student and teacher engagement as well as integrated language learning. Comprehensible input is expanded and students acquire discipline specific language and interaction skills as they collaborate with peers. Creative examples of thematic learning modules are provided specifically related to science and the environment. A wide variety of web-based resources are available that include valuable information for educators and students. Integrated language learning and ICT accompanies numerous thematic frameworks, and the curriculum and instructional materials are available in multiple languages. Among the examples provided is a collection of integrated lessons and resources in the sciences. By engaging a community of learners in a thematic curriculum of teaching and learning that integrates ICT and language learning, students are motivated and challenged to high ideals and positive outcomes.

AB This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a study proposal with the intent of knowing Scratch potential in Educational Sciences students' training. In this study, we analyse, through different phases, using Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model (KEM), the benefits of Scratch inclusion in Educational Sciences degree and in its students' future professional activities. In this work an action-investigation methodology is used. This investigation will allow to improve the education curriculum at different levels, in a technological way, with impact on the teaching and learning process, involving students and teachers of all levels. In higher education this software has been especially associated with programming and computing disciplines as a tool for motivating students or as a learning facilitator. This work presents not only an innovative approach of the Scratch utilization, the improvement of learning skills and competences of design regarding the production of educational materials, but also its use in a new area - the idea of a programmer-educator concept. This paper also presents a pre-study regarding the necessary skills to the use of Scratch and its use among first level students focusing in their satisfaction and motivation for this software use.

DE model of innovation; virtual reality; e-learning; work-life balance;
   communication
AB In a very busy society, e-learning is not a trend, but a must, because it facilitates distance interaction through virtual networks, social networks, forums and virtual reality (VR) facilities. The future of e-learning is to simulate reality by virtual reality, placing students in real life situations (e.g. Sims game). ICT students have a multitude of learning and entertainment programs, while using a gaming platform where the action is not realized by the mouse, but by editing comments in a structured / procedural manner, such as For i from one to n, hit the opponent. Those who study medicine learn anatomy and how to make surgeries through VR. Those who study chemistry can experiment with dangerous substances in a safe environment, due to VR. Those who studies languages may be transported in the Elizabethan times, for example, with the help of holograms. And so on... Modern universities have to adopt these technologies and to integrate them in every field of learning. They have to collaborate with the business environments, be one step ahead of them, and invest in research. The business environment has to ask universities for solutions to their problems, and the business has to offer the infrastructure for research in universities, because the young students are very creative. The article offers a model of innovation and creativity in the exchange between universities and the business environment. A deep understanding of the human psychology and the needs of spiritual evolution helps us move forward in the context of circular economy, for a better future for the next generation.

AB Internet and the related Information and Communications Technologies (the ICTs) has become an important component of teaching and learning in higher education. The concept of e-Learning is subject to constant change and can be defined as a learning system based on formalised teaching with the help of electronic resources. E-Learning systems can include fully online, mixed mode (also known as Blended Learning) or web assisted courses and there are numerous tools and features at the disposal of students and universities teachers. The main objective of this paper was to highlight the role of and the need for e-Learning in Romanian higher education. In order to achieve this aim, two main research activities were carried out. First, an extensive literature review was performed for understanding the e-Learning technologies and their applications in academic environment. Second, an exploratory research was developed to identify the students' education preference, perception regarding e-Learning effectiveness and their readiness to its adoption. A structured questionnaire was designed and applied to the graduated and undergraduate students of The Bucharest University of Economic Studies. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics and other tools available in Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results of the survey revealed the positive attitudes towards e-Learning and technology-mediated education, especially among graduated students. Participants of survey also considered that e-Learning enhances the understanding of course content and improve collaboration and interactivity between students and teachers. These findings allow to draw suggestions for future research directions and recommendations regarding e-Learning implementation in Romanian higher education.

AB ICT-based training is one of the fundamental paradigms of modern education. With the increase in the performance of computing and communications equipment and the crystallization of new approaches in the education sciences (pedagogy, docimology, behavioural and learning psychology), complex educational systems tend to impose as indispensable working tools for modern education.
   Strong theoretical models and increasingly advanced information and communication technologies have led to a significant increase in the effectiveness of today's educational computer systems. The continued expansion of modern communications systems on a global and national scale and increased access to the Internet has led to the development and diversification of ways to disseminate the educational content in digital form. The significant development over the last decade of ICT and the implementation of more and more technologies in education are evidenced by the increasing supply of complex educational systems characterized by an ever higher quality. At present, information systems devoted to the educational process can be analysed in terms of several criteria: the objectives pursued; targeted users; educational services offered; the resources involved; ergonomics and performance of systems; purchase, implementation, and maintenance costs. In the Faculty of Communication and Public Relations, within the National School of Political and Administrative Studies, there is a 19-year experience in designing, performing and implementing tests designed to be used in computer assisted self-training, self-assessment and evaluation modalities. There is a framework for designing tests and items that was distributed to most of the teachers and used when the tests were created. Thus, the erroneous didactic design of some docimological tests was avoided to a great extent and the performance of very thorough analyses of performances was possible, that were performed on a computer.

AB The increasing tendency of digitalization, present in today's society, have an impact on education, as well. The benefits of using technology in the classroom have been mentioned in various studies. The internet offers many educational resources that can be used both offline and online and can be the proper instruments to support the instructional process. However, many studies on technology-assisted instruction highlight several factors that require a permanent restructuring and updating of contents, and also the adaptation of the applied didactic strategies. Among these factors there are: the particularities of new generations of students, the rapid evolution of technology, many existing web resources, the variety of instructional strategies, the diversity and complexity of studied disciplines etc. To facilitate the learning of various disciplines, and especially the basic scientific disciplines such as chemistry, it is necessary for teachers to be able to easily identify educational technology resources, and integrate them effectively in the didactic activity. Chemistry is an important discipline in preparing students and is one of the essential branches of science. Difficulties encountered by students in learning this discipline have been highlighted in various studies, and requires identifying the best strategies for teaching-learning of chemistry. Thus, the use of technology in teaching supports students in the learning process, can contribute to a better understanding of abstract concepts of chemistry and play an important role in reducing learning difficulties. Both theoretical and empirical research studies can provide useful information to practitioners and theorists in the field. The present paper represents a theoretical study on the implications of using technology in teaching chemistry. The study was performed by analysing of some scientific works, which aim at teaching chemistry assisted by technology. The main objective of the paper was to identify the most commonly used resources / tools and best practices for their use in teaching chemistry.

AB Digital native students are a challenge for some teachers. In Romanian educational context, not all teachers allow students to use the technology freely and independently in order to handle learning tasks. This study aims to investigate the correlations between students' self-perceived digital competencies, relevant related attitudes and their level of self-direction in learning, alongside with their perception of how teachers relate to the use of technology for the educational process (teaching & learning). For this study, we used a cross-sectional design, with data collection in multiple sequences, from a non-randomized sample of 200 undergraduate students, distributed into 2 groups (technical and non-technical specializations), with no intended intervention. The methods used in collecting data were online survey (using questionnaires) and focus-group interviews. The results indicate that students' level of self-directed learning correlates with the frequency of using digital tools for learning. Furthermore, students that are prone to a high frequency and more complex usage of technology due to their specialization, are more likely to report a more favorable attitude towards digitalized learning than students majoring in social sciences. Also, the more self-directed the students are in their learning, the higher they score on their self-efficiency level. The results show that the higher the level of self-efficiency is, the better their level of self-perceived digital competencies is. We also observed that their level of self-perceived digital competencies could be associated with their self-efficiency level. Moreover, seems like a higher level of learning satisfaction appears in students whose teachers allow them to decide independently about the frequency and modality of technology usage in their learning.

ID PHYSICAL-EDUCATION; CLIL; MULTIMEDIA
AB There has been a trend toward incorporating elements of ICT and e-learning from primary school to higher education (Huang et al., 2009). It has been successfully used in many different contexts, subjects and with different purposes. The aim of this paper is to highlight the use of these pedagogical tools as a support in teaching/learning Physical Education (PE) through English in the CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) approach. It has been demonstrated that the use of technology has a high positive impact on the teaching and learning processes (Gimeno Sanz, 2009; Qi & Zou, 2016). In fact, it has been claimed that educational approaches based on e-learning and ICT represent an excellent vehicle for success (Bodea, 2016).
   First, this paper will review the literature on the use of e-learning, multimedia technology, exergames, virtual learning and multimedia in Physical Education courses. This will be followed by a discussion of integrating ICT and CLIL methodology in PE. Next the paper will propose ways to blend these three elements (ICT - Physical Education - CLIL) and show the advantages of integrating them in a given educational scenario. Finally, options and examples of using ICT in PE through CLIL at different educational levels will be discussed (Marsh D., Mehisto P., Wolff D., Frigols Martin M.J., European Framework for CLIL Teacher Education). As a conclusion, ICT and e-learning may be successful tools to overcome difficulties and improve the teaching and learning practices of Physical Education using English medium instruction with the CLIL approach.

AB Incorporating online resources and activities into a college or university course curriculum requires educators to acquire appropriate knowledge and develop skills necessary to supervise the educational process in a smart, i.e. technologically-rich and pedagogically innovative, environment. A move towards interactive, collaborative and active learning structured around e-learning components and Internet tools involves training teachers to gain comprehensive ICT and pedagogical competencies necessary for handling new education modes. The ideas presented in the paper are supported by opinions and attitudes expressed by staff from three higher education institutions, each with a different focus on technology and technology-based career paths: Poznan University of Medical Sciences (Poland), West College Scotland (United Kingdom) and Gdansk University of Technology (Poland) in a survey conducted in 2017 and 2018.

AB the work is an analysis of contemporary problems related to chemistry teaching in a primary school. Problems, which result from the collision of dynamically developing digital and multimedia culture with the teaching trends that still prevail at schools. The dissertation presents three pillars on which modern education in the field of natural science can be based: scientific theory, experimental practice and graphic illustration of chemistry - a school subject, widely regarded as difficult and uninteresting. In order to support the efficient and effective implementation of the lesson topics the problem-based learning method using the traditional school textbook and the problem-based learning method supported by infographics and ICT was proposed. Both methods were aimed at students who have learning problems and also those who are gifted. The effectiveness of selected methods has been checked during chemistry lessons, and the conducted surveys have allowed to assess the level of understanding of knowledge and acquired skills.

AB The inquiry based science education (IBSE) differs from the instruction which insists on remembering facts only; it is a transformation into such a process which emphasizes understanding the concept and process of acquiring new knowledge itself. The centre of the problem is in the fact learners become involved into inquiring science relations and principles, they connect information into a meaningful context, develop their critical thinking and support to the positive approach to natural sciences. The term of "inquiry" is synonymous with research, exploration, investigation, survey, examination, testing, i.e. with procedures which are typical for natural sciences as such; and which should be reflected and implemented in their process of teaching and learning. Sometimes the "inquiry-based" instruction is defined as the transition from the deductive to inductive instruction. Despite this really is a method of considerable strengthening the inductive approach to the cognitive process, it cannot displace deductive ways of cognition from the science education. It should work in co-operation of both sides of one process, i.e. it provides mutual complementarity of cognitive tools of empirical-inductive and theoretical-deductive type. The IBSE is characterized by four levels which relate to the share of management within pupil ' s activities from the teacher ' s side - the confirmed, structured, guided and open inquiry. Each type requires specific application of the ICT depending on the support of basic methodological tools of the natural science cognition. Theoretical background and practical examples are described and discussed in the article.

AB Some research suggests that the use of instructivist teaching strategies may be detrimental to learning while other research asserts that such strategies can enhance learning under certain conditions. In this article I make the argument that the conditions present in South African low-quintile 1-3 schools, and, probably, more broadly in schools typical of developing countries, make such strategies appropriate and may indeed be the only strategies currently implementable on a large scale in the South African low-quintile school context. I propose two kinds of instructivist resources, low-language-demand drill-and-practise worksheets and software, that may be effective in improving learning in this context by developing language competence, increasing feedback and reinforcement, and extending teaching and learning time. I caution against a simplistic interpretation of the argument, and discuss possible difficulties. Discussions such as this are necessary in our search for appropriate and implementable solutions to the crisis of South African underperformance in education.

AB The evolution of information and communications technology (ICT) has impacted various sectors, including the educational sector. Accordingly, several methods have emerged, such as electronic learning (e-learning), to support the education process. Learning management systems (LMSs) include various features that could be used by higher education institutions to support e-learning activities. However, the implementation of LMSs in non-scientific colleges is not as simple as it is for scientific colleges, such as computer and information sciences colleges, because of the information technology (IT) background differences between the system's stakeholders (students and academic staff). Thus, the improper implementation of LMSs in non-scientific colleges may play a major role in not realizing the expected benefits from such initiatives. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual model for non-scientific colleges to successfully implement LMSs. This model gives a look at the critical success factors (CSFs) for LMS implementation. The CSFs are related to the student, instructor, system, university support, and change management.

AB Our research compares the improvement of the students' stereometry competence of ellipsoids, cylinders and cones using two teaching approaches. The first one employs our ICT-oriented learning method specifically targeting the Van Hiele model for stereometry concepts. The second method is based on the traditional approach of teaching university students. The study deals with second year undergraduate students form the Department of Civil Engineering at Piraeus University of Applied Sciences. The sample was divided into two groups (experimental and control). The results showed that the teaching approaches of our intervention, with the additional use of ICT using the background of the Van Hiele model, contribute significantly more to the development of university students' stereometry competence as compared to other traditional methods.

AB The purpose of the study was to identify the ICT self-efficacy (ICTSE) of users, factors affecting ICTSE, and the EIR usage of undergraduates based on the four sources in relation to the self-efficacy theory. The Survey research design was used in carrying out this research. A structured questionnaire was validated through experts and piloted among the final year undergraduates studying Humanities and Social Sciences of four state universities in Sri Lanka. The structural equation modelling was performed using partial least square. The model revealed that ICTSE has a direct, negative, and significant relationship with ICT anxiety and that ICT training also has a direct, negative, and significant relationship with EIR. The model explained that there is a 27% of variance in the EIR use variable. The management of the library may deem it a worthy investment to instil adequate self-efficacy in users and encourage them to engage in more self-reliant search practices and decrease their dependence on staff. The finalized scales provide a potential tool applicable to different domains and disciplines to yield more common managerial implications in relation to training, teaching, and learning along with can be used as a tool when policy-level decision are made about the behavioral changes among university users on EIR usage in the current ICT domains within the university library systems.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the learners' perceptions on the use of online resources at the Namibian College of Open Learning (NAMCOL) Yetu Yama Resource Center.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a mixed methods research approach which was also used by other researchers such as Hamutumwa (2014). it enabled the researchers to delve into the topic under study by conducting a survey using self-administered questionnaires to collect data from learners, and a semi-structured interview guide, to collect data from the Librarian, the Director and tutors. The target population for the study was Grade 12 distance learners registered with NAMCOL for the academic year 2016, librarians and tutors. Convenient sampling was used to select 200 Grade 12 distance NAMCOL learners: one Director, one Librarian and five tutors were purposeful selected as they manage the Yetu Yama Resource Centre The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to generate descriptive data, while qualitative data were manually analysed using content analysis. This approach enabled the researcher to identify key themes which emerged from the interviews.
   Findings - Almost all the learners (159) opted for printed materials. The challenges experienced by learners included slow internet, as indicated by 78 (39 per cent); limited facilities, 60 (30 per cent); and inability to find relevant information, 46 (23 per cent), coupled with lack of proper guidance on the use of e-resources as indicated by 16(8 per cent) learners.
   Research limitations/implications - This study was limited to Yetu Yama Resource Center. The results cannot be generalised to all distance learners in Namibia.
   Practical implications - The results of this study could guide librarians in Namibia when planning and/ or upgrading e-resources.
   Social implications - Once the learners are equipped with the required skills, they will make optimum use of the e-resources which are provided by NAMCOL.
   Originality/value - This is the first study to be conducted at NAMCOL, and it is hoped that the results will be applied to other tertiary institutions which offer distance education in Namibia.

DE Heterocyclic chemistry; biological active compounds; photosynthesis;
   alkaloids; new style of chemistry teaching; quick research
AB Interest of students in natural sciences shows a declining tendency all over the world. Chemistry along with physics belongs to the least popular subjects. Research shows that one of the main causes of this state is the way chemistry is taught at schools. The students' style of learning is currently changing due to the influence of information and communication technologies. It is thus necessary to seek innovative approaches to teaching chemistry. Using a digital classroom and laboratories is one of such approaches. The present paper describes an interactive relationship of heterocyclic chemistry for lower secondary schools.
   Heterocyclic compounds are basic components of both living matter and chemistry of other materials around us. Teaching of heterocyclic compounds is difficult for students on primary and secondary schools. The general educational program of Ministry of Education appeals interdisciplinary approach to chemistry studies. The topic of this paper is heterocyclic chemistry composition in educational process for primary and secondary schools. The goal of the process is barrier elimination among computer, classroom, laboratories and reality. We would like to describe these compounds not only as chemical species, but characterize heterocyclic compounds as biologic components of the live around, laying emphasis on their physiology activity. Next connection indicated the scheme (cooperation of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, etc.).
   Photosynthesis (for example) is a chain of chemical reactions occurring in chloroplasts (chlorophylls are typical heterocyclic compounds composed from pyrrole), the microscopic organelles inside the green plant tissue. In the course of the photosynthesis, a plant uses the energy of sunlight and, from the molecules of carbon dioxide and water; it synthesizes glucose (heterocycle), with oxygen being produced as a by-product. Photosynthesis is paramount importance for the life on the Earth because it releases oxygen and produces sugar which, either directly or indirectly, serve as food for the majority of animals. All described processes in computational field (including laboratory) are founding.

DE e-learning; comparison; anatomy
AB In the Physical Therapy Degree Program, as well as in many other health sciences degree programs, the subject "anatomy" is clearly one of the most essential subjects for any student. However, despite a long tradition, conventional anatomy education based on pictures, anatomical or cadaveric models, is becoming more involved into innovative learning approaches, taking advantage of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Current understanding of the psychology of learning encourages teachers to integrate both cognitive and motivational components. Thus, turning students into active creators of content and incorporating e-learning into their study routines, may be useful to create a more satisfactory and effective learning experience, compared with traditional approaches.
   For this reason, the main purpose of this study is to analyze how the incorporation of e-learning affects students' motivation to learn and to determine whether e-learning could be favored by students, compared to traditional learning.
   To carry out this study, Physical Therapy students of University of Lleida were invited to voluntarily participate in the study. 72 students were included, and they were divided in groups of 4 people. After the e-learning experience, they had to fill a questionnaire.
   Results showed that students declared their personal preference in favor of adding e-learning tools to teaching. Students perceived their learning with this methodology to be superior to that of more classical approaches reporting higher levels of motivation.

DE WhatsApp; blended learning; undergraduate medical education;
   communication application
ID EDUCATION
AB Background: Smartphones and smartphone applications (apps) are nowadays trendy, especially among adult learners and Facebook is a well-accepted instructional social media for graduate medical education. Literature has shown that incorporation of Information and Computer Technology (ICT) with medical education is a new pedagogical strategy in cultivating dynamic engagement and shared learning of undergraduate medical students. To the best of our knowledge, albeit there is a growing amount of study on the impact of social media tool such as Facebook group, YouTube, Pinterest and Twitter in medical education, the use of communication application, for an instance, the messenger for as instructional aid is under-researched. The purpose of this study is to investigate the usage of WhatsApp group messenger as a teaching and learning tool in medical education and its effectiveness on interactive and collaborative clinical medicine learning.
   Study design: Quantitative comparative study
   Study population: Fifty-four third year medical students from faculty of medicine and health sciences, University Malaysia Sabah, Malaysia were participated in this study. Informed consent was taken. They were separated into three rotation groups based on the average cumulative grade point average(CGPA) score, gender and ethnic. During the 8-week medicine junior posting, second and third rotation group was randomized to follow one of the two different blended learning; conventional e-learning platform or informal WhatsApp group messenger.
   Results: Several usages of WhatsApp group messenger were observed not only as communication purpose but also for instructional purposes such as uploading e-books and lecture presentations, sharing clinical images and videos, instant feedback, exam preparation, discussion of clinical cases between the lecturer and students. Most active clinical case question and answer discussions were observed during last three weeks of rotation before the end posting exam (week 4 to 7). It was noted that an average of thirty (70%) interactive messages per week, related to module learning outcome was uploaded by the lecturer and 30% was contributed by the students itself. More than 80% of students were found to be active users. The group taught by blended learning method using the WhatsApp group showed statistically significant higher marks in end posting exam than other group (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: WhatsApp group is a promising potential blended learning platform which enables student's active engagement in collaborative learning and enhances the student learning experience. Its convenience of usage, user-friendliness and flexibility in learning while maintaining socialization allowed the students to communicate with the educators at any time, any space. Future research of other communication applications in teaching and learning clinical medicine should be explored.

DE teaching chemistry; information and communication technologies; blog
AB The purpose of this text is to reflect on pedagogical experiences with the use of digital information and communication technologies (DICT), in specific use of blog, in the teaching of Chemistry. The planned experience took place over two months and was carried out in high school classes of public school. Other technological determinist theories affirm that the technologies are the responsible to determine the socio-historical directions of the context. The results showed that the structural conditions of classroom, computer lab and internet access at home greatly influence the achievement of activities using digital technologies. On the part of the students, it was observed that their engagement is not directly linked to the use of a TDIC, but to the type of activity that is performed through them. Thus, the blog, when used pedagogically, can motivate the interest of the students, but the fact of being an intemet tool does not guarantee this. It is possible to conclude, therefore, that theories directed at technological determinism are questionable, since only the presence of technology can not meet the pedagogical needs of the educational process; It continues to depend on the teaching action and the learning situation.

AB The technology of integration of learning methods, forms and means of information and communication technologies is described with due regards for psychological and pedagogical characteristics of student groups. The results of theoretical and experimental research conducted on the basis of two Ukrainian universities with the participation of 341 students in the "Chemistry" training area and 18 lecturers of basic chemical disciplines are highlighted. Both students and lecturers were polled in a specially designed questionnaire to show their attitude to the use of various electronic learning resources in learning and teaching basic chemical disciplines. Students' preferences in learning styles were estimated on the basis of a self-scoring questionnaire for assessing preferences on four complementary dimensions, such as perception (sensitive or intuitive), input (visual or verbal), processing (active or reflective) and understanding (sequential or global) of chemical information. Such an approach is known as the method of Felder-Soloman, and it allows one to calculate Indices of Learning Style which assess qualitatively available preferences of all respondents in each of the four available directions. The developed technology allows lecturers to qualify an optimal set of electronic learning resources for the teaching of individual sections of chemistry, taking into account preferences in their use of students with different learning styles. The technology under development is based on the calculation of average resource scores as assessed by all students in the group, as well as on the expert evaluation of the feasibility of their application in the teaching of basic chemical disciplines. The taxonomy of the optimal selection of electronic learning resources and teaching methods is developed for each type of students' learning preferences. Advantages and disadvantages of all available variants of the application of the developed technology are discussed for student groups of different compositions. An example of the application is given for studying the discipline "Inorganic Chemistry".

This research investigated the difference of improvement of students' creativity and cognitive achievement due to the use of android-based games on Chemistry Nomenclature in learning method of team-assisted individualization (TAI) into the improvement of students' creativity and cognitive achievement. This was an quasi experiment research with non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design involving 2 groups of students of X grade of a senior high school in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, SMAN 1 Seyegan, Sleman. The groups were experiment and control which were chosen randomly, involving 32 students in each group. The difference of learning model in the two groups were the use of android-based games within learning model of TAI in the experiment group, but it was only the use of TAI model in control group. The android-based games were developed and validated previously in this investigation, and were excellent in quality for the use in Chemistry learning process, and were reported separately. The data of both students' creativity and cognitive achievement were measured before and after learning process. Data of students' creativity were collected with the instruments of questionnaire and observation sheets, and the data of cognitive achievement were collected with a set of test. Statistical analysis of MANOVA was used to analyze data to measure the difference of the improvement of students' creativity and cognitive achievement between experiment and control groups. The results showed that the improvement of creativity and cognitive achievement of students in the experiment group was higher significantly than that in control group.

AB Implementation of evolution lectures at Biology Department Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences State University of Padang has been considered not optimal The reasons are the limited availability of textbooks and students' learning attitudes. Because currently the students are very familiar with the internet and even has become a necessity, it has developed textbooks of evolution based on ICT and metacognitive. Selection of ICT based is in order to optimize the utilization of multimedia, and this is very compatible with the development of learning technology. While metacognitive based is in order to train students' learning attitudes to be able to think analysis, creative and evaluative. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the use of evolution textbooks based on ICT and metacognitive to the cognitive competence of students of Biology Department State University of Padang. The data of this research is students' cognitive competence obtained from the implementation of effectiveness test of evolution textbook in the form of student learning outcomes.

AB At the start of the new century, teaching was transformed by the new communication technologies. Teaching-learning models, mediated through computers, have catalyzed new ways of teaching and learning beyond spatial and temporal coordinates. E-learning, blended learning and mobile learning offer a new universe of interactivity for teaching purposes. This work reviews the state of research studies and scientific literature on the new reality created by blended learning, analyzing its conceptualizations in the main scientific databases, with more than 7000 entries in Web of Sciences and almost 95000 in Google Scholar. The outcomes of this work show the strong momentum of good practices and the subsequent research in all the areas and levels of education, transversal competencies, teaching methods, educational materials and technologies. The main conclusion is that new ways of teaching and learning should be studied and understood regarding their connections with new learning media and contexts, starting from the incursion of the blended learning revolution.

AB This article analyses the differences in basic digital competences of male and female university students on Social Education, Social Work and Pedagogy courses. The study of gender differences in university students' acquisition of digital competence has considerable didactic and strategic consequences for the development of these skills. The study was carried out at two public universities in Spain (UNED - the National Distance-Learning University, and the Universidad Pablo de Olavide) on a sample of 923 students, who responded to a questionnaire entitled "University Students' Basic Digital Competences 2.0" (COBADI - registered at the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office). The research applied a quantitative methodology based on a Bayesian approach using multinomial joint distribution as prior distribution. The use of Bayes factors also offers advantages with respect to the use of frequentist p-values, like the generation of information on the alternative hypothesis, that the evidence is not dependent on the sample size used. The results show that men have greater perceived competence in digital cartography and online presentations, whereas women prefer to request personal tutorials to resolve doubts about technology and have greater perceived competence in corporate emailing. There is also evidence that the men have greater perceived competence in developing "online presentations" than women do. Regarding to, "Interpersonal competences in the use of ICT at university", we observed that the female students opted for personal sessions with tutors in greater numbers than the male students did.

AB The presence of intelligence and rationality in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet requires a new context of analysis in which Herbert Simon's approach to the sciences of the artificial is surpassed in order to grasp the role of information in our contemporary setting. This new framework requires taking into account some relevant aspects. (i) In the historical endeavor of building up AI and the Internet, minds and machines have interacted over the years and in many ways through the interrelation between scientific creativity and technological innovation. (ii) Philosophically, minds and machines can have epistemological, methodological and ontological differences, which are based on the distinct configuration of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Their comparison with rationality and its various forms is particularly relevant. (iii) Scientifically, AI and the Internet belong to the sciences of the artificial, because they work on designs that search for specific aims, following selected processes in order to achieve expected results. (iv) Technologically, AI and the Internet require the support of information and communication technologies (ICT). These have an instrumental role regarding the existence of AI and the Internet. Also ICT shape their diverse forms of configuration over the years.
   Within this framework, this paper offers a new context of analysis that goes beyond Simon's and follows four main steps: (i) the interaction between scientific creativity and technological innovation as the philosophico-methodological setting for Artificial Intelligence and the Internet; (ii) artificial intelligence and human intelligence as epistemological basis for machines and minds, where the differences between artificial intelligence and human intelligence are made explicit (under the consideration of "computational intelligence'') and the analysis of minds and machines is made from the perspective of rationality ("symbolic rationality'' and "adaptive rationality''); (iii) intention and its difference with design of machine learning are considered to distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence; and (iv) the internal and external aspects of artificial designs in contemporary society are considered through the perspective of rationality, which leads to the transition from intelligence to rationality in the Internet as well as to the historicity of information (how aims, processes, and results can be based on conceptual revolutions).

AB Mathematical modeling is the activity that represents, manipulates, and communicates real-world objects with mathematical content; it also allows the simulation of complex processes, generates hypotheses, and suggests experiments or validation methods. Mathematical modeling is presented as a teaching strategy to simulate and interpret different real or academic life problems and situations by demonstrating different application conditions of university mathematical course contents. Specifically, in Calculus II, the strategy seeks to address the need to show and manipulate contents applications of improper integrals, series and Taylor polynomials, polar coordinates, and conic sections on specific problems with examples in biological sciences and engineering areas. This implementation respond to a paradigm that seeks innovation and continuous improvement of teaching and learning processes which is pertinent because of the existence of a platform incorporating ICTs (Information and Communications Technology) in Calculus II, and favoring the use of specialized software for the creation and manipulation of mathematical models.

The theoretical research model included the collection of information on four variables: 1. Technology; 2. Learning process; 3. Teacher-Student Interaction; and 3. Demographic characteristics of the participants (gender, age group, schooling, teacher's exercise) to analyze the perception of students and teachers about the use of (ICT) in higher education. The adopted research instrument considered twenty questions and was applied to undergraduate students in Pedagogy; Masters and doctoral students and professors of the Post-Graduate Program in School Education of the College of Sciences and Literature - Unesp. Based on the obtained results it was evidenced that the Information and Communication Technologies as mediators of the teaching and learning process involve much more than the use, access and appropriation of technological and methodological innovations in the educational processes; involve the social construction of knowledge.

AB Aim: The second level students from the Nursing School at the State University of Bolivar have been only using printed teaching material since 2013, so that they presented difficulties in the comprehension and learning of the biochemistry; the majority pupils did not manage contextualized and interrelate with clarity the thematic of the 14 didactic units of the subject and they limit themselves to memorizing the concepts. Objective and Method Used: The present research reveals the results obtained with the design and implementation of the guide "The Chemistry of Life" with the support of hypermedia tools to learn Biochemistry. For the development of the hypermedia application, it was used the program of visual author Multimedia Builder version 4.9.8., in system Windows Office and others software's for the audiovisual production. To that end, two groups of students were selected, a group control with whom in the teaching learning process of the biochemistry was used the traditional methodology and the experimental group, the guide, during 2014 academic period. Result and Discussion: The design applied was quasi experimental, to contrast the results themselves, that were submitted to a statistical, descriptive, and inferential analysis to showed, that with the use of the digital guide and the supported in the hypermedia application improved consistently the learning biochemistry and consistently in the student's performance that belongs to experimental group in contrast to those of the control group. Therefore, the utilization of the guide is recommended and its complement, its structure comes added with information and communication technological, in hypertext format and multimedia, becoming it an educational technological innovative resource, which is characterized for being not linear and interactive, useful for the new generation and new forms of biochemistry learning and optimize the work in the classroom.

AB Background: The demand to use information and communications technology (ICT) in education and research has grown fast among researchers and educators working in global health. However, access to ICT resources and the capacity to use them in global health research remains limited among developing country faculty members. In order to address the global health needs and to design an ICT-related training course, we herein explored the Chinese health science faculty members' perceptions and learning needs for ICT use.
   Methods: Nine focus groups discussions (FGDs) were conducted during December 2015 to March 2016, involving 63 faculty members working in areas of health sciences from six universities in China. All FGDs were audio recorded and analysed thematically.
   Results: The findings suggest that the understandings of ICT were not clear among many researchers; some thought that the concept of ICT was too wide and ambiguous. Most participants were able to cite examples of ICT application in their research and teaching activities. Positive attitudes and high needs of ICT use and training were common among most participants. Recommendations for ICT training included customised training programmes focusing on a specific specialty, maintaining a balance between theories and practical applications, more emphasis on the application of ICT, and skills in finding the required information from the bulk information available in the internet. Suggestions regarding the format and offering of training included short training programmes, flexible timing, lectures with practicum opportunities, and free of charge or with very minimal cost to the participants. Two participants suggested the linking of ICT-related training courses with faculty members' year-end assessment and promotion.
   Conclusions: This study among health sciences faculty members in China demonstrated a high level of need and interest in learning about ICT use in research and training. The results have important implications for the design and implementation of ICT-related educational programmes in China and other developing countries.

LA English
DT Article
DE models; projection; science education; 3D projections; interactive
   models; science education; biology
AB PISA study has defined several key areas to be paid attention to by teachers. One of these areas is work with models. The term model can be understood very broadly, it can refer to a drawing of a chemical reaction, a plastic model, a permanent mount (taxidermy) to advanced 3D projections. Teachers are no longer confined to teaching materials and aids available physically at schools. Thanks to information technology, models can be included in lessons almost without any limits. However, work with models is very specific due to the simple fact that a model always differs from what it represents. Efficiency of education using ICT can be affected negatively in case that work with complex models requires high level of abstraction which pupils are not capable of (Harrison and Treagust, 2000). Jancarikova (2015) points out that due to the demands on upper secondary pupils - children must be taught how to relate models to real objects from very early stages. Linking an object to its model - isomorphism is the basis for successful work with models. Work with models thus must be developed systematically and consistently and included into teaching of younger learners. The scope of work with models in natural sciences is gradually increasing. However, the fact that we are able to project models to pupils using information technology does not mean that pupils will be able to understand them. In this paper we want to point out that not enough attention is paid to work with models (not only in the Czech Republic) - methodology of work with models does not exist and is not taught to pre-service teachers. The paper classifies types of models we come across in lessons, describes basic differences between objects and reality they represent and proposes possible ways of systematic inclusion of models into teaching.

AB With the objective of knowing the assessments that the students, who had used learning objects in augmented reality, made of them, an "ex-post-facto" study was designed in which 429 students participated in the subjects of "Educational Technology" and "ICT applied to Education" attended the Primary and Childhood Education of the Faculty of Education Sciences of the University of Seville.
   In order to know the assessments of the subjects, an "ad hoc" questionnaire was designed with a Likert type construction that sought to gather information on three dimensions: technical and aesthetic aspects of the object produced in RA, ease of use, and a guide developed to facilitate the understanding of the Performance of the object by students.
   The positive evaluations made by the students, among others, allow us to point out that these resources can be valid for their incorporation into the teaching-learning processes.

AB Along this decade, advances from Cognitive and Computing Sciences disturbed the college campus, namely, via the availability of online courses (MOOCs) and tools, and also the secondary schools with e-learning environments. The technological impacts helped to democratize traditional university education and brought, to everywhere in the world, the teaching of wonderful professors through Internet (YouTube). Yet, the lectures are still alive, and the old fashion pedagogy seems in good health, most of the students do not participate fully in the process of learning. What is missing is a profound shake-up of mentalities, new initiatives to accelerate learning research and the discovery of the resilience of the whole process. Artificial intelligence and information and communication technologies (ICTs) in general are sound proposals to open alleys till a happy solution, and in this study, we try to show some ideas about the disruption of the traditional classroom scenario due to the availability of innovative online resources and computers (tablets, smartphones, and laptops).

The analysis covers the working time of two teams, namely the subject teachers, the course authors (A) who prepare the subject contents, and the personnel with ICT competence, in charge of drafting digital learning materials and their publication on the e-learning portal (B). The costs of preparing such an e-learning course are distributed across a few years' period of utilization. Annual accounts of the costs of groups A and B work on preparing a single multimedia lecture cycle should account for the number of participants and the limitation of organizational costs. The time needed to work on a multimedia course can be minimized through improving the level of ICT competences among professional staff (A) and through selecting an experienced team of IT specialists (B).

Therefore, the general objective of the study is to analyze and describe the training in ICT of the monitors of the Andalusian day centers from a gender perspective. It has been used a methodology of descriptive and non-experimental nature and quantitative cut. Data analysis and treatment were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPPS) v.23 for Mac. The t-student statistical test for independent samples was applied for the establishment of statistically significant differences from the gender perspective, assuming the principles of normal distribution of the sample and homogeneity of variances. The ANOVA test was made to determine differences between provinces. The actual sample of data has been of 207 participants of centers of all Andalusia. The results to be highlighted in the training environment of the day-time center monitors, blended learning and distance learning in ICT tend to be reduced, as well as knowledge about socio-educational practices through ICT in this context. Likewise, it is male monitors that maintain a greater training for problem solving through ICT. In addition, it is the monitors of Cordoba, Cadiz and Granada who have greater experimentation and self-taught learning of ICT.

AB As years go by, students show very little interest in STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) areas, while at the same time, they are very active in using information technologies. Numerous studies show that nowadays, both in business and private environment, we use information and communication technology that we cannot live without. The idea of including information and communication technology in high schools has been converted into a European project named ICT science laboratory. The project's holder is private grammar school Gaudeamus in Osijek, while project partners are private grammar language school Pitagora in Split and Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Osijek. During the project, five educational trainings were held, which dealt with outcomes of learning, developing a curriculum and using multimedia content. Teachers from Gaudeamus and Pitagora participated in the aforementioned education. After the trainings, a study among teachers was conducted using a qualitative method - interview. Study was conducted in order to analyze attitudes of participants who took part in curriculum development based on learning outcomes including information and communication technology. Teachers from Split and Osijek, eight of them, took part in the study. Data was collected using a semi-structured interview in which the participants presented their attitudes and opinions concerning education, school systems in Croatia and application of sources and tools in their own teaching plans and programs. Each conversation was recorded and transcripts were made for each interview based on which the participants' answers were analyzed. This paper presents the study results.

DE ICTs; acessibility; higher education
AB The ICT's (Information and communications technology) are nowadays one of the most proficuous instruments in providing acessibility to deaf people in the higher education institutions (GEDIEL; SOARES; OLIVEIRA, 2016). However, develop these technologies is a challenge faced by professionals involved in that task. A university from Minas Gerais' Zona da Mata developed a new class conception based in e-learning to empower the learning/teaching process of a deaf Math sciences student from that institution: the sign class. The methodology of building this new tool was made through a theoretical reference, study groups and technical visits. The process of developing this material was made in five stages. On the first, the teacher provides the class script and other teaching instruments of the course to the team. On the second, the "glosa" (FERREIRA BRITO, 1995) is made based on the content provided. Third, the deaf people and the translators review the "glosa" and provide solutions to identified problems. Fourth, the team create a audioguide and begins to record the sign classes. Fifth and the last phase, the material is finished and made available to the student. The development of the sign class was a huge challenge to the methodology of teaching deaf people, because is all about a method that harness various people. The creation of these content, as well as provide the deaf people a real learning of the course, also provides a better proximity and integration in the university lifestyle.

AB Modern society requires specialists being able to perceive, create, interpret and implement knowledge. Thanks to rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT), methods of organizing learning in higher education constantly require new approaches to educational process. The majority of graduates of Russian universities are experiencing difficulty in applying for a job. Creating the most effective conditions for realization of goals and objectives of learning a foreign language in high school is today one of the main directions of educational policy.
   One can't deny that today it is quite impossible to imagine learning a foreign language without the use of ICT (multimedia technology, telecommunication technology, computer technology, etc.).
   In our view, a hallmark of present development and application of new information technology in teaching university students a foreign language is active involvement of non-professionals in the sphere of computer engineering. In our case such "non-professionals" are foreign language teachers. The development and use of computer based learning materials at university today is still undergoing significant difficulties, because their creation requires the knowledge of diverse sciences: Foreign language, Psychology, Pedagogy, Mathematics, Informatics, etc.
   The article describes a multimedia testing system for conducting language olympiads at the university, being carried out with the help of telecommunication technologies. Main tasks, components and technical, didactic, methodical, psychological-pedagogical characteristics of this testing system are specified. The system makes it possible to assess the level of intercultural communicative competence of university students in such kinds of speech activity as reading, writing and listening. The article defines the main goals of foreign language olympiad at the university for the university students. It is underlined that language olympiad analysis with the help of new information technologies facilitates monitoring educational process enabling teachers timely to correct the contents of education at the university.

ID LECTURE
AB To understand health/disease processes in cooperation with multidisciplinary teams is a skill that future health professionals should have. For this purpose, students have to acquire competences that are difficult to achieve with the conventional methods. In this scenario, the use of active methodologies could be useful in order to develop the required competences necessaries to assure health promotion and improve patients' quality of life. During the academic year 2016-17, we developed an educational innovation project based on the resolution of clinical cases with students from different degrees related to Health Sciences, at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). The undergraduates that took part in the project belonged to Dentistry, Dietetics and Human Nutrition, Nursing, Pharmacy and Physiotherapy. Virtual classrooms and a final debate were carried out with the students to discuss the most relevant aspects of the clinical cases and the methodology used.
   Objective: The aim of this work was to identify the aspects considered of greatest interest by the students about the use of active methodologies and cooperative education on the resolution of clinical cases from a multidisciplinary approach.
   Methodology: The assessment of the activity was performed through an anonymous online survey. This survey consisted on 23 questions grouped into five sections: a) Student's information (four questions); b) Assessment of the methodology (five questions); c) Usefulness of ICTs application (three questions); d) Effectiveness in achieving transverse and specific skills (three questions) and e) Personal assessment about the activity and possible improvements (six questions). The results were analyzed and plotted with the statistical program GraphPad Prism.
   Results: For evaluating the results, the survey was filled by the students after the clinical case was solved. In total, 63 students completed the survey. Some of the best-graded aspects were the improvement in searching relevant information, knowledge integration, ability to analyze situations from the professional practice and ability to reach agreements. In general, most of the students were highly interested (4/5 or 5/5) in using this type of methodologies in the class (51%).
   Conclusions: The use of active methodologies for the resolution of clinical cases in a multidisciplinary way promotes collaborative learning among the different Health Science degrees involved in this work. The high acceptance level and favourable evaluation of this methodology by the students raise the need to increase the use of this type of activities, since they establish professional scenarios that encourage active and cooperative learning, and point out the value of the collaborative resolution of clinical cases.

AB In the last years, a high dropout rate has been observed during the first years of university studies. In addition, in studies related to health sciences (Pharmacy, Biomedicine, Medicine.), we can appreciate a strong fear towards the subjects that involves Chemistry. This can be clearly seen from the fact that a large percentage of students give up the subject before getting to the corresponding evaluations. This fact can be the trigger, in many cases, of the definitive drop out of their studies.
   Specifically, in the Pharmacy Degree (at the University of Seville), our own experience indicates that approximately 35% of the students give up the subject of Medicinal Chemistry. Part of the presented problem might be attributed to the passivity and stiffness of the classical teaching methods commonly used at universities, which diminishes the attractiveness of the subjects and reduces the enthusiasm of the students. Therefore, a change in the way of teaching and leading our students along their way through the University is necessary.
   In order to overcome this problem, our team of teachers proposes an alternative method of teaching that combines the methodology of Problem-Based Learning (BPL), collaborative learning and technological applications. In this proposal, we will implement the use of specialized software in chemistry, which can be acquired with university license, to approach the virtual design of new drugs with some potential specific activity. The use of these strategies will provide the students a new perspective much more interesting of the Medicinal Chemistry, since they will have to overcome new challenges using technological tools that are very attractive and are usually quickly assimilated by them.

AB ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) can be very useful for the transmission of scientific contents facilitating access to information. In this context, the different tools offered by the Internet, are based on synchronous and asynchronous communication between professors and students promoting not only the tutorial action of the professor, but also the possibility of educational experiences with teachers and students not present in the immediate environment of the centre. This work analyzes the use of ICT in an Organic Chemistry course at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Seville. Through a survey conducted to students, their perception of the use of the virtual platform as a tool for the teaching-learning process was obtained.

AB Mathematics as a knowledge field of the exact sciences, use specialized language, laws, properties, theorems, axioms, methods, and the results of the operations thereof can be expressed in numerical, functional and graphical forms, which are commonly used in the academic field from arithmetic used in elementary education to higher mathematics used in Academic Programs related to engineering.
   One branch of mathematics is called Differential Equations, which have a great number of applications in the engineering field, however its learning requires previous knowledge of other mathematics branches, which are not less important, among these are: algebra, trigonometry, analytical geometry, differential and integral calculus.
   Mathematics as a scientific knowledge field are structured through its language and methods, this necessary knowledge is not forgotten, but as student's skills remain inactive due to a lack of practice, these are rather difficult to activate when a situated engineering problem needs to be solved.
   The solving of a situated problem having starting conditions is called modeling and can be very tedious or difficult, and its characterization involves developing cognitive skills in the Mathematics field, and, in an interdisciplinary way, using other fields related to Engineering Sciences.
   Learning Differential Equations is linked by using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and Learning and Knowledge Technologies (LKTs), in particular the Maple and Mathlab software, without disregarding the valuable contribution of the learning which allows for constructing concepts in the traditional way and applying both starting points in solving engineering problems such as in the present case, regarding the acquisition of pollution profiles in water, soil and air compartments.
   The studied solutions to these differential equations have been focused on the most commonly known pollutants, such as: emerging pollutants, agrochemical contaminants, volcanic ashes and greenhouse effect gases, by reconfiguring the use of information technology and communication towards a transition in learning and knowledge technologies.

AB South East European University (SEEU) is moving towards the use of Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) to meet the needs of the studies that has been implemented since its foundation. However, the resources and lecturer skills in developing their classroom instruction has caused the learning culture to remain unchanged, especially in master courses. The purpose of this study is to understand the lecturer and students' perception and their achievement between two learning cultures, the traditional classroom and flipped classroom. As a relatively new model of instruction, lecturers need evidence that the Flipped Learning model has an encouraging impact on important student outcomes, including achievement and engagement. To meet this need, the Flipped Learning model (FLM) was applied in the master course Information Technology Project Management (ITPM) offered in the second semester in the master program Business Informatics, under Contemporary Sciences and Technologies Faculty at SEEU in Macedonia. In this study is presented the impact of the flipped classroom model on students' course achievements, the initial experience form flipping the classroom as well as the additional evaluation techniques applied in order to enrich the assessment elements of the student performance.

ID ACHIEVEMENT
AB The education process is transforming rapidly owing to the widespread availability of computer platforms to produce and distribute digital content. Mixing teaching aids is now one of the most popular methods used to improve the effectiveness of the teaching process. An area which is especially dedicated to the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the teaching process is mathematics. ICT can help science students and teachers to perform calculations, explore mathematical objects, and interactive visual mathematical concepts. The integration of ICT into teaching practices can increase the level of mathematical understanding at all stages of the educational process.
   The aim of this paper is to present a particular hybrid teaching system, that integrates several software tools for supporting teachers and students in teaching and learning mathematics. The presented solution uses the OpenOlat learning platform and the GeoGebra dynamic mathematics system to build a complete, interactive teaching and assessment tool for high school students. This solution is implemented as one of the courses placed on the educational, commercial platform EduPlatforma.pl.
   The project EduPlatforma.pl was created in Poland to build and enhance the development of e-services supporting education. The project aims to support modern and innovative education, that uses all available methods and tools, and promotes the use of the Internet and multimedia. EduPlatforma.pl offers over 680 learning-ready modules which cover a wide range of topics, e.g.: Polish, English, German, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and history.
   The system is designed to illustrate mathematical ideas with interactive examples, which can be parametrized through on-line widgets. In addition to theoretical content, each module includes tests and tasks which allow self-evaluation. Exercises are prepared especially to improve the students skills in logical and abstract thinking by exploring the potential of the GeoGebra tools. The integration of modern interactive software tools leads to a more diverse and complete education and is more attractive for students than traditional learning. Moreover, using prepared and pre-configured software tools allow students to quickly discover in a visual way the power of mathematical tools, which may also support their development in different areas. Evaluation of learning progress is automatic and encourages the participant to thoroughly understand the content before the completion of each stage. All results are stored in a dedicated database, which allows the teacher to perform a detailed analysis of student activity.
   The implications of the results are discussed and avenues for future research are suggested. These findings encourage the use of open source as well as GeoGebra learning solutions that support student requirements for more dynamic and interactive study of math.

AB With the arrival of the European Higher Education Area, the Universities had to transform their methodologies in order to adapt them to the new requirements, focusing on competencies. In this way, lecture rooms are changing with the aim to promote a dynamic learning instead of the traditional master class.
   In this scenario, this paper presents the results obtained from the implementation of a teaching innovation project developed, during the course 2014-15, in the subject "Strategic Management". More specically, the sample of this study was integrated by students from the 4th course of Business Administration and Management degree from the University of Cantabria (Spain). This project is based on two essential pillars: (1) the use of cooperative learning such teaching methodology, and (2) the use of new information and communication technologies (ICT) such an essential tool in the learning process.
   Related with the first essential pillar, the use of cooperative learning, professors proposed to the students a team work during the semester in which they applied the theoretical concepts acquired from the master classes to a real firm. In this sense, combining master classes and practical classes in the classroom, the students elaborated and presented at the end of the course a strategic analysis of a real company.
   Regarding the second essential pillar, the use of ICT in teaching activity, this subject used Moodie platform in order to promote interaction between students, and between students and professors. In addition professors used this platform in order to provide tools like forums, chats or interesting links to support the study.
   The incorporation of the teaching innovation project had two main goals: (1) Firstly, the implementation of innovative learning activities in the subject and, (2) secondly, the improvement of the evaluation process. Results show that the first aim was achieved completely, while the second objective was achieved only partially.
   More than 93 per cent of the students decided to participate in the proposal and approve the subject through the continuous evaluation, that is to say, using cooperative learning. Results show that there are differences between students participating/non participating in the proposal: Around 65 per cent of the students participating in the cooperative evaluation approved the subject, while only 50 per cent of the students that don't following this system approved. Also the average of qualifications was different: 5.3 points (out of 10) was the average of students participating, and 4.8 points was the average of students non-participating.
   Finally the paper presents the perception of the students which was measured through a questionnaire at the end of the semester. Within this questionnaire students provided their own recommendations for future initiatives, an information that can be a valuable asset in providing feedback and suggestions for educators

DE Engineering Education; Integrated Curriculum; Learning Experience;
   Learning Methods; Teaching Methods
AB A major change within the Finnish system of Universities of Applied Sciences was introduced as a governmental reform in 2014. [Helsinki] Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)(1) introduced changes, especially in all engineering programmes. The rationale of the steering reforms are briefly introduced.
   As an institutional response, many UAS's reacted in their own way and strategy. MUAS in general, introduced larger units of teaching and learning. A fragmented curriculum including dozens courses, typically 3 ECTS can be challenging. If they run in parallel for the whole of academic semester, the student may have up to 10 courses in parallel. Losing of focus is easy. The general principles of the new curricula is discussed.
   The main structural changes were introducing minimal load of a course to 5 ECTS and compressing the length of all courses to half-semester, i.e. 8 weeks. This creates the parallel load on three courses only. Some programmes went even further, especially in the first study year, by integrating these into 15 ECTS integrated theme per each half-semester, now to be called a period. This style of integration into periods was in various forms introduced by many degree programmes, such as in Information and Communications Technology, and Electronics and Automation. Learning outcomes are discussed using Industrial Networking course as example, both comparative and longitudinal between the old and reformed curricula.
   The implementation shifts activity away from lecturing towards various forms of flipped classroom, using lecturing style only to introduce new tasks, leaving more teaching resources to help with the learning tasks. Subject matter integration into larger thematic areas, often in project form, forces to integrated teacher team collaboration at least in weekly basis. A tight coupling of teaching activity and removal of potentially irrelevant or overlapping substance matter enhances more focused student learning experience. A case study of stepwise refinement is discussed.
   This paper focuses on this stepwise transformation process as a case study of one 3 ECTS course: Industrial Networking, originally implemented by one lecturer to a 15 ECTS course, implemented by team of four teachers. Four of the course implementations are in various individual forms, followed by the 5th implementation in an attempted integrated form. The three first implementations are analysed based on lecturer's own reflection on the structure and implementation. The last two are compared using a student feedback, both quantitative and qualitative. In both implementations the content of the subject matter and the learning objective has been relatively unchanged, however the transformation process over the various teaching methods provides an insight of a change process as a case.
   Other experiences in MUAS, especially in ICT major of Health Technology, have shown a way forward to even larger, thematically integrated semesters, but now with highly integrated student learning experience, including an applied project work, mainly done to real clients outside the UAS. This case study is based and supported strongly by the thematic mind-set. Industrial Networking being the first implementation of the author in area of Automation technology, some areas of development, both in implementation details and in teacher team co-operation could be critically reflected, based on student feedback.

AB Acknowledgement of the value of a basic freehand sketch by the information and communication community of researchers and developers brought about the advanced developments for the use of sketches as free input to complicated processes of computerized visualization, so as to make them more widely accessible. However, a sharp reduction and even exclusion of this and other basic visual disciplines from education in sciences, technology, engineering and architecture dramatically reduces the number of future users of such applications. The unique needs of conservation of cultural heritage pose specific challenges as well as encourage the formulation of innovative development tasks in related areas of information and communication technologies (ICT). This paper claims that the introduction of basic visual disciplines to both communities is essential to the effectiveness of integration of heritage conservation needs and the advanced ICT development of conservation value, and beyond. It provides an insight into the challenges and advantages of introducing these subjects in a relevant educational context, presents some examples of their teaching and learning in the modern environment, including e-learning, and sketches perspectives to their application.

AB INTRODUCTION. This research work aims at determining the evaluation of seven Web 2.0 as useful tools to work on inclusive education. It focuses on the use of social networks, blog and/or edublog, forums, WebQuest, wiki, virtual learning environments, online office applications; for the development of their presence, participation and progress as strategies that involve an inclusive educational context considering that both inclusion and ICT are fundamental to education in this century. METHOD. The fundamental objective is to study the evaluation given by 213 university students (Spanish and Mexican) of programs related to the Educational Sciences on several Web 2.0 tools as resources that promote the basic principles of inclusive education, for which a quantitative methodology will be used through an ex post facto design. RESULTS. The main results of this study indicate that Spanish students evaluated Web 2.0 tools, blog and/or edublog, WebQuest and wiki more positively to promote strategies of inclusive educational environments than the Mexican students surveyed. By contrast, the latter used more social networks that the former for academic purposes. DISCUSSION. The outcomes of this research point out the differences of the university education systems of Mexico and Spain, in consideration of the ratings given to the principles of inclusive education through the use of ICTs, as well as knowledge and both personal and academic use of the seven 2.0 resources studied. The use of blogs and/or edublogs as a methodological and technological resource for promoting principles of inclusive education were the resources with the highest ratings for both Spanish and Mexican students.

AB The aim of this research was to empirically validate constructs for evaluation of teachers' attitudes toward usage of educational software in chemistry teaching. Questionnaire with items transformed from UTAUT (Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology) and other technology acceptance theories were filled in by 556 Czech chemistry teachers. All constructs passed recommended.7 thresholds of Cronbach's alpha so they can be used in acceptability researches before and after introduction of educational software or building models. However, analyses of effect sizes show that there are not only differences between users and all nonusers generally, but also prove differences between various types of nonusers. Nonusers were established as a) those who had used educational software and abandoned it; b) those who do not use educational software, but are planning to use it in the future, and c) those who do not use educational software and have no intentions to use it. An unexpected finding reveals that differences among subgroups of nonusers can be even larger than between users and nonusers, especially the group c) is an outstanding group. Consequently, factors and their influence on the acceptance and use of educational software in chemistry teaching should be explored for each group separately.

AB The main objective of the Chemistry laboratory practices in Agronomy Engineering is to show experimentally some of the theoretical contents. Nevertheless, one of the main problems we face when teaching Chemistry to 1st course students of Agronomy Engineering degree is that some of them have not ever been in a Chemistry laboratory before and, therefore, they find it very difficult to pass their laboratory practices exam (summative assessment) without any extra-support.
   In this work, we applied online formative self-assessment with the objective to offer an extra-support to the students to reach the level need to pass the laboratory practices exam. With this goal in mind, we have used the blackboard learn tool to design a five-question test available online after each laboratory session. The premise to build each question was "teach while assessing", trying to teach while the student is reading the question so that the student can use this acquired knowledge when answering the question. The online formative self-assessments were offered to the students only during the second four-month period as a voluntary class assignment.
   At the end of the school year, we evaluated the influence of formative assessment on the summative assessment, comparing the existence of improvement in the final laboratory practices exam results. The 80% of the students, who realized self-assessment during the second four-month period, improved their result in the final exam of laboratory practices in relation to those obtained at the end of the first four-month period. Conversely, only the 50% of the students that did not perform self-assessment were able to improve their results in the same situation. These and other evidences of this case study, show important indications that by using online formative self-assessment designed with the premise of "teach while assessing", students can improve the understanding of the Chemistry laboratory practices.]

AB The University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), founded in 2002, was the first new university in Ontario, Canada in over 40 years. Located in Oshawa, Ontario, the university was founded to address a shortage of highly qualified personnel in areas of health sciences, engineering, science, educators with technological skills, and management and information technology disciplines.
   A founding feature of UOIT was the development and implementation of a Technology Enriched Learning Environment (TELE). This program was fundamental to the development and design of the university. The TELE program embraced the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in all aspects of teaching and learning as well as incorporation into program design, course outcomes, and curriculum development.
   One of the central outcomes of the TELE program has been the development of new teaching and learning practices that build upon innovation and the rich technological infrastructure of hardware, software, and ubiquitous connectivity on and off campus. One emerging practice within the Faculty of Education has been the evolution of online teaching to embrace synchronous, online learning modes for graduate classes. There have been different definitions put forth to describe the blending of synchronous and a-synchronous learning but most of these definitions involve elements of both face to face (or physically present) learning and online learning. The polysynchronous learning environment (PLE) described in this paper runs fully online in real time but adds both synchronous and asynchronous as between-class elements. The hosting instructors employ a blend of active learning and collaborative learning pedagogies: maintaining the rich, interactive elements of the traditional university seminar and the flexibility afforded by emergent synchronous technologies. Faculty beginning the journey from the classroom to online teaching and now synchronous online programs employ a number of strategies and choices in course design and setup which we characterize as a form of pedagogy which is virtually silent to the students. This paper is an attempt to make more visible these deliberate pedagogies of teaching in a fully synchronous graduate program and to propose a model that allows faculty to better understand the pedagogical choices made when preparing to teach in similar types of environments.

We elaborated a questionnaire in order to identify the curricular preferences of the above mentioned students (n=92), aiming in the same time to analyze the relationship between two major variables: students' interest regarding the attractiveness of disciplines as part of the educational curriculum and students' perceptions concerning academic subjects' utility with regard to the professional training curriculum. The results have confirmed the conclusions of several previous surveys regarding the curricular preferences and have opened, in the same time, new perspectives, for further research and development in the field of professional training curriculum, from the perspective of the new information and communication technologies.

TI Smart cities and their domains - Future challenges for urban

DT Article
DE smart cities; social science; challenges; big data
AB During the last decade, smart cites become a fashionable subject of urban development conferences and urban policy forums. Both in the international scientific literature and public media, discourse about smart cities and their development became considerably popular. This multidisciplinary theme attracts researchers from three main disciplines. The first is telecommunication engaging with the technological infrastructure of smart cities (ICT engineers, programmers, architects). The second is ecology which deals with urban sustainability and viability issues (ecologists, environmentalist professionals). The third discipline is social sciences (sociologists, regional scientists, geographers, economists) investigating the social consequences of smart cities' development.
   The first part of this paper reviews the history and main characteristics of the smart city as a notion in the international literature. It highlights that the role of ICT development and the rise of postindustrial new middle class fundamentally affect trends of smart city visions. Afterwards, it presents those smart city domains which are highly relevant for development strategies. Among them are hard domains where ICT engineering, computing and big data are crucial, and soft domains where the role of social inclusion, participation and democracy is more important. This part of the study highlights those linkages between social sciences and smart city development which can act as research fields for regional and social researchers. Every smart city domain provide promising research themes where the solidity and raison d'etre of "smart" ICT solutions can be tested by social scientists. Finally, the last part of the paper seeks to pinpoint those type of challenges which researchers of space and society need to face if they would like to study smart city development and counsel their innovation. It particularly highlights three issues: refocusing towards the "smart" world, learning to handle "big data" and building relationships with IT firms and programmers for a multidisciplinary teamwork. Because of the increasing role of the digital world and of the ubiquity of the internet in social life, trying to answer these challenges are and will be the essential issue for urban researchers in the 21st century.

AB This research is focused on secondary school chemistry teachers' (N=276) and chemistry pre-service teachers' (N= 159) attitudes towards the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in education. A questionnaire constructed upon Rogers' theory of diffusion of innovation was used. Based on the answers, the respondents were grouped according to their innovativeness - into types of innovation adopters. Analysis of the participants' responses to the statements in the questionnaire suggests that neither gender nor their teaching experience influence their innovativeness. The respondents mostly tend to hold a pragmatic view, accept the role of ICT in education. However, they need proof to decide whether to adopt it in their teaching practice. As the respondents could leave their contact information, it is possible to further focus on particular groups of innovation adopters, to observe their lessons, analyse their approach and mainly influence and support those groups, which maintain a "role model" position and trigger diffusion of innovations.

AB From the question, what should we do to teach physics more effectively in colleges and universities? This article proposed to try to specify the possible applications of the ICT that can be recommended to improve the teaching of discipline. A review was done for both Academic (997 references) and ScienceDirect (737 references). The number of articles found revealed the diversity of approaches, applications and contexts in which one way or another apply ICTs in physics.
   The content analysis made it possible to emphasize that the application of ICTs requires a cognitive approach and what is more important that these are framed in a learning environment. The lack of research on the effects of the application of ICTs and the different perceptions of students and teachers precludes the formulation of general strategies.
   Since the quality of the teaching of the Technical Sciences depends on the student being able to use real laboratories, it is important to stimulate research on the use and experiences in the development of remote and virtual laboratories that can constitute low cost alternatives.
   An experience in the use of ICT in teaching physics that can be extrapolated to other disciplines is the importance of simulation with the use of ICTs or specific programs that allow analyzing mathematical models that allow analysis of systems of various types.

AB This team learning and team entrepreneurship model of education has been deployed at the Bachelor's level in the degree programmes of IT and Business Administration (BA). In BA studies the students who take part in team learning have specialized in marketing since 2009 at the Saimaa University of Applied Sciences (SUAS). The model called ICT entrepreneurship study path (ICT-ESP) has been developed for IT education. The ICT-ESP has been built on the theory of experiental learning and theories of knowledge creation and knowledge management. The students study and complete their degree as team entrepreneurs. The model has been further developed in the Business Administration Degree Programme with students who specialize in marketing. The Degree Programme in IT at the Bachelor's level was terminated in 2011 by Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture. Currently, there are severe discussions on bringing it back - not as an IT but as an ICT Degree Programme.
   This article makes a cross-section of what has already been explored with the team learning and team entrepreneurship model and what the next steps will be. It makes a comparison of two originally separately developed models and discusses their best practices. The article also argues whether the upcoming ICT education should be organized in a conventional way - as curriculum of courses, or as expansion of the current team learning and team entrepreneurship model. The data consists of field notes, meeting memos, and dozens of unofficial discussions with colleagues and company representatives. Literature studies made during the ongoing research, development, and innovation (RDI) projects offered an extra view of how the business context is changing and what should be done to make benefit out of the change.
   The results suggest that the upcoming ICT Degree Programme at SUAS should be integrated into the existing deployment of team learning and team entrepreneurship learning environment. This would foster collaboration between different disciplines, e.g. marketing and ICT. Furthermore, the emerging ideation, service design and experimentation ecosystem which we are developing in ongoing RDI projects, would be strengthened by adding more students focused on ICT competencies into it.
   The article was later extended to include interview data from 12 themebased specialist interviews where the thoughts of original article were tested among administration of our campus, RDI funder, experienced and former team entrepreneurs, and local entrepreneurs.
   The results validated the author's previous suggestions of how future ICT education should be organized and also provided some new targets for development. The essential findings were: The future ICT education should be deployed in a way that it a) develops students' entrepreneurial mindset b) offers versatile cooperation possibilities with existing marketing team entrepreneurs and other enterprises, and c) the current ecosystem should be internationalized.

AB While the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) continues to transform learning, international migration and the increasing complexity of intercultural exchange and communication continue to do so as well. In this paper, we connect the dots and ask how ICTs can be used to enhance the learning experiences of international students. Using a case study of a new program for first-year international students at a Canadian university, we bring together insights from blended learning and multiliteracies approaches to show how multiple cultural references and multimedia can form the basis for the development of new potentials between learners, knowledge, and disciplinary practice. This involves an analysis of the innovative structure of a two-course sequence in Human Geography, followed by a discussion of student feedback on the model. Based on our results, we conclude that blended learning offers not only a sophisticated approach to multiliteracies in the context of an international student setting, but for teaching students in the social sciences and humanities more broadly.

AB The existence of a new educational paradigma has led to the revision of the elements that have traditionally participated in the learning process. The emergence of Information and Comunication Technologies has eased the access to new types of educational materials that are causing a global revision of the contents' production and methodologies to implement in the classroom. The publishing world and the leaders of the different educational levels have to face the challenge of given an answer to this process of change. This is currently a debate in many schools. The aim of this study is to analyse school leaders' perception of the digital content, their more relevant features and their impact in the educational world in the short and middle term. It is usually the leaders of the schools who make decisions in relation to the training plans aimed at technical and methodological improvement. To do this, the study is based on a methodological descriptive design backed by a survey. Among the conclusions we highlight the need for adaptability of digital contents to different contexts and the requirement of teachers' training in the pedagogical use of ICT through a solid and sustained formation programme as a strategy to implement this innovation in a larger methodological framework.

That process included three phases: document review; surveys done to students and teachers; structured interviews to school principals and deanship. The results show there are appropriate curricular elements to venture into innovation proposals regarding academic offer in terms of flexibility and ICT incorporation in training programs. Likewise, the blended learning is an option which contributes to the quality of education, access opportunities and the educational processes improvement. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB The likelihood that students pursue an active citizenship in the future is increased if we encourage them to act now, in the present, providing them with opportunities to do so, and regarding them as citizens capable of contributing to the solution of current problems. The present research, involving a group of students from the 8th grade (12 to 13 years old) and the subjects of Natural Sciences and Information and Communication Technologies, had the purpose of studying the impact of the production and dissemination of vodcasts, subordinated to the theme of environmental pollution, in the perceptions of students regarding their capacity for action and their development of activism skills. The construction of vodcasts by students, being usually associated with leisure and entertainment, can also be used as an activity for science teaching and learning. In this study, its production and subsequent dissemination was also used as a strategy for activism aimed at education. The study followed a quantitative approach, and is part of a larger quali-quantitative study. The results show a positive evolution in students' perceptions regarding their empowerment for action, and the development of basic skills for research based collective action.

AB With regard to the growing interest in developing teacher education to match the twenty-first-century skills, while many assumptions have been made, there has been less theoretical elaboration and empirical research on this topic. The aim of this article is to present our pedagogical framework for the twenty-first-century learning practices in teacher education. We will first review the current status of policy frameworks for the twenty-first-century learning skills. Based on our previous work and current understanding in the field of learning sciences, we will next elaborate the processes and strategies for collaborative problem-solving skills and strategic learning skills to specify current, rather general claims presented regarding the discussion on twenty-first-century skills. We will also provide concrete case examples facilitating strategic learning skills, collaborative problem-solving skills, and the skills to use information and communication technologies in contexts of our previous studies.

AB There is no doubt that for those who are not English native speakers, to learn this language is imperative.
   The difficulties associated with acquiring the skills and competences related to a foreign language can be reduced with the incorporation of ICT in different areas of the educational process. One of them is the possibility of using bilingual educational material, accessible in an electronic way and with playful components. Because the students work daily in a world where images and the internet become more and more dominant, we have chosen a comic book, accessible through computer networks, as a vehicle for learning.
   As everybody knows, the learning process is much more effective when it involves communication of meanings which are appealing to learners, to achieve specific goals. The principle underlying this is that learning will be more effective where language is used purposefully. A comic provides easily understandable concepts. It is an open and flexible tool, useful for those involved in teaching English and in teaching Sciences. It can also be the basis for developing teaching materials and activities giving the scope for working individually and in collaborative groups. It allows teachers to give useful formative feedback to their students, which in turn leads to learning. As the language used is seen as purposeful, the comic sets out a socio-cognitive approach, developing communicative language competences in a natural context.
   The comic in all its variants, not only comic books for children or adult literature, is experiencing a new boom. This is the case of the experience described in this paper: the use of the science literacy comic book "Granny Tell Me Why", which we have already described in other works and which is now also accessible to students through computer networks and their mobile devices as an innovative and high performing tool to learn/teach English and sciences effectively.
   The comic, of fortnightly periodicity, tells the adventures of a high school student living with his grandmother, a divorced and very active scientist. Science topics are developed in the comic, through exciting adventures they live together.
   The first full season (24 issues), of the three so far developed, have been translated into English. The comics are made available to readers through a web platform that downloads a new story every fortnight.
   In addition, through a content manager system, teachers are provided with manuals for using the material in the classroom for the development of typical language teaching skills: Written Comprehension, Oral Comprehension, Oral Expression and Written Expression.
   An evaluation instrument was developed and applied to gather the opinion of teachers and students about topics such as whether there was a greater interest of the students on the topics, if they improved their grades or if the use of the comic favored the development of multidisciplinary skills.
   Pilot tests are currently being carried out in elementary and secondary schools in Spain to evaluate the effectiveness of the comic as a vehicle tool for improving English language skills. After using the comic in the classroom, the results will be analyzed from the point of view of English teachers, science teachers and students. Surveys will also assess the cross-skills that the comic foster, such as autonomy, teamwork, leadership, initiative, self-evaluation.

DE Collaborative learning; Teaching statistics; Blended learning
AB Various strategies may be applied for teaching statistics. Lectures, equipment, teamwork and guidance are all important to help students to become capable of using statistics to analyse their own work and the results produced by others. Students following the second year from the Chemistry Pharmacology and Biology curricula (QFB) in the Faculty for Higher Studies Zaragoza (FES-Z), UNAM start becoming familiar with simple concepts and procedures, such as percentage, average, mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, confidence intervals and probability. They also learn to correctly elaborate standard curves and to interpret both graphically and statistically the results of their experiments. Our university provides wired and inalambric facilities for a wide and fast access to the institutional and public networks. The information can be accessed from various devices, like tablets, smartphones, personal and institutional computers. Thus, the students can connect, search, upload, download and interact in various ways through digital means. Our institution's policy is to guarantee that limited access or insufficient knowledge of information and communication technologies (ICT) will not be a barrier for our students. Instead, they may benefit from state-of-the art digital communication systems and guided learning to use them properly [1]. The students receive files containing full information about experiments designed to answer specific questions. Then, by using their knowledge on statistical procedures and interpretation of results, they must describe, analyse and conclude if the experiments have been properly performed and what is the significance of the results. Teams of 4 or 6 students are formed in order to promote exchange of information, collaboration and discussion. Teachers are always following their progress, making comments and helping them to resolve their doubts [2]. This tutorial-guided students' teamwork stimulates and promotes critical analysis of information and problem solving thinking [3]. Students' capacity to develop critical thinking and proper application of statistics are both important qualities for a solid academic development.

DE Education; Virtual Reality; Educational Innovation; Virtual Environment
AB In an educational system formed by methodologies of the 19th century, teachers of the 20th century, and students of the 21st century, the educational innovation mediated by Information and Communications Technology (ICT) should settle once and for all. Our students live daily with cutting-edge technology, including Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).
   In this article, we propose the design of an educational tool with immersive virtual reality technology, with the possibility to interact with the virtual environment with the aim of offering simulations, interactive experiences and evaluations. Therefore, it is a virtual reality tool to be used by professionals of the education. On the other hand, from the point of view of the student body, will be seen as an educational resource more enjoyable and motivating than traditional resources, such as text books or videos.
   The agenda included in this tool is framed within the field of the natural sciences. In particular, it will help to interact with the environment to learn in first person the possible causes and consequences of their destruction.
   In this way, teachers will be able to achieve higher levels of education, in which not only takes into account the knowledge or wisdom, but an education based on a few basic pillars in the form of "learning to learn", "learning to do", "learning to be" and "learning to live together". In this regard, both the VR and the AR encourage a moral commitment to be aware of their acts, to live an experience in which they are immersed, and to be protagonists of their learning, instead of being mere spectators.

DE Innovation; Initial teacher education; ICT; Methodological renewal
AB In the context of the initial teacher training, namely in the Supervised Pedagogical Practice, it is imperative that the future teacher has the opportunity to develop skills that dignify him in the 21st century, but also that he is encouraged to (re)create the new educational paradigm, finding propulsive impulses of dynamic spheres of innovation and entrepreneurship, responsibility and opportunity for growth. In this sense, and knowing that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an enormous potential for renewal of the educational paradigm and teaching professionalism (Quadros Flores, 2016), the study aims to know educational experiences with ICT: what they do, how they do and what teachers do feel and what impacts do they observe.
   In this context, we analysed seventeen lesson plans that applied digital resources carried out in the primary school by future teachers attending the Master's Degrees in "Pre-School Education and Teaching of the First Cycle of Basic Education" and Master's Degree in "First Cycle of the Basic Education and Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the Second Cycle of Basic Education". Three activities were selected with the criterion being innovative, useful, usable and transferable to other contexts. In order to understand what they observe and feel during the implementation of the practices, we opted for a qualitative methodology of a case study. Data were collected from a questionnaire with two open questions applied to seventeen future teachers carrying out the Supervised Educational Practice (internship) in the primary schools. For data analysis, we used content analysis. The results show that, when teachers use technological resources, they adopt a constructivist methodology and that, during the class, they observe impacts on the student, on the learning process and on the school results. The analysis of the answers also reveals effects in three dimensions, essential in the process of teaching and learning: in the motivation, as a means by which the learning is realized, in the understanding that in turn it gives meaning to the learning and the satisfaction, as the result of the motivation that facilitated the comprehension and that, therefore, improves the results of the students and the professional accomplishment of the teacher. When questioned about what they felt in managing an ICT class, they looked at the process of teaching and learning, regarding the student and regarding themselves (teacher). They show, therefore, that the feeling experienced by the teacher in the pedagogical act has a direct relationship with the teacher, as a professional (capacity of methodological, strategic and resource selection, creative capacity in the construction of an environment favourable to the process of teaching to learn), as a person (sensations experienced, responsibility, commitment), but also with the impact on the student. Thus, it is concluded that the success of technology integration depends mainly on the teacher, his technical training in the domain of the tool and his professional training in methodological domain, as well as other skills, such as creativity, resilience, entrepreneurship and leadership.

Although most Teaching Institutions now have the necessary infrastructure to adapt their syllabus to the demands of new technology, a lack of preparation on the part of the staff to teach via the new media leads to a failure to adapt, marked discrepancies in performance and frustration on the part of teachers. There is a need to develop teaching and learning processes that may be applied to ICT, to modify teaching models and methodology and to unite universities and schools in a commitment to reformulate it towards the "educational 2.0".
   This research was initiated in the 2013-14 course at the Faculty of Education Sciences of the University of Cadiz (UCA). The objective is to propose the musical literacy of the students of Degree of Pre School and Primary Education through the use of programs of free software. Each year students use these computer programs to perform good ICT practices in the music classroom.
   Our results indicate that the use of ICT in learning music promotes the process of building and rebuilding knowledge in a new interactive climate of cooperation, while eliminating spatial and temporal barriers. It affords the opportunity of creating virtual-learning communities, increases the motivation, concentration and understanding of the student and ultimately enhances the development of students' musical and IT skills.

DE video-mediated extension approach; social learning; smallholder farmers;
   farmer innovation; rice; Uganda
AB Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools such as videos promoted to enhance farmer access to information to influence change in farming practices need to be situated in social learning processes. Farmers learn and innovate through social learning characterized by exchanges amongst farmers to contextualize knowledge and adapt technologies for relevance. This study assessed how a video-mediated extension approach (VMEA) triggers social learning to enhance innovation among rice farmers in Uganda using experiences of a Non-Government Organization, Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG 2000). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 farmers subjected to VMEA by SC 2000 in Kamwenge district. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), field observations and key informant interviews were used to collect the quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) while thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. Results indicate that inherently, videos trigger conversational exchange between farmers including those who do not watch the videos. These interactions enable collective reflection, evaluation and validation of knowledge, which in turn motivate experimentation. In this study, videos significantly enhanced awareness, knowledge acquisition, uptake of technologies and innovation among rice farmers. However, the potential of videos in influencing farmer knowledge and behavioral change can be further exploited if the users can produce contextualized videos of farmer practices and innovations for dissemination. Among other things, effective use of videos in extension requires excellent skills in facilitating social learning processes; and video documentation of farmer practices and innovations to aid scaling up and deepening learning.

AB The constant technological development in education, and the potentiality of the resources offered by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), are challenges faced by teaching institutions in Brazil, especially by those institutions, which by the very nature of their services intend to provide distance education courses. In such a scene, one sees the use of technology as a tool to give support and to take part in the process of teaching activities, such as the Virtual Learning Objects (VLOs), which offer an opportunity to contribute to the teaching and learning process. Considering this, the present work aims at analyzing the VLOs used in the distance education courses of Economic Sciences and of Accounting at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (Federal University of Santa Catarina), under the quality criteria indicated by the Learning Object Review Instrument (LORI) methodology proposed by Nesbit, Belfer, and Vargo (2002), Nesbit, Belfer, and Leacock (2004), and Leacock & Nesbit (2007), in order to learn how to better take profit of efforts and resources.

AB Educational laboratories are places for realizing experimentations and they are important for modern engineering education. The problem is what if there are simply not enough devices or time for conducting experimentation in a local lab? Other factors that prevent the use of local lab devices directly by students are inaccessible or dangerous phenomena, or polluting chemical reactions. The new technologies bring additional strategies of learning and teaching, so it becomes a challenge to integrate the information and communication technologies ICT into the engineering sciences learning. Nowadays, there are two types of online labs, virtual and remote labs. Virtual labs that provide simulation environments for experimentations, remote labs are based on conducting the experimentation remotely through the Internet. In this paper, an example of a successful development and deployment of a cloud based remote lab in the field of engineering education, integrated in the Moodle platform, using very low-coast, high documented devices and free software. The remote lab is user friendly for both trainers and students.

AB The complexity inherent to technological integration in the context of basic education in the current reality of the students and the digital culture that permeates society today features a transformation in the dynamics of knowledge construction. It is difficult to connect students, fully involving them in this process when using traditional teaching and learning methods. This new context requires interdisciplinary research for better understanding, involving experts in the field of sciences and more technical areas such as engineering and computer science. To answer the question of how to handle the evolution of interdisciplinary theoretical and empirical studies related to the subject, it was developed a survey in order to understand the evolution, interdisciplinarity and the theoretical and empirical variables related to the integration of technologies in the Brazilian basic education. This article presents the results of the exploratory survey of systematic review procedures of literature in electronic databases, then bibliometric and descriptive analyzes. Among the obtained results, were identified as strategies for the integration of technologies in Brazilian public basic education: Remote Experimentation for Physics, Mobile Learning and Software teaching for practices in Mathematics classes. The studies are divided into six large areas of knowledge: Social Sciences, Decision Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Business and Mathematics, demonstrating the interdisciplinarity of the theme.

AB The use of information and communication technologies (ITC's) is the subject of discussion by most Brazilian educators. If it is recognized as a potential resource in favor of the teaching-learning processes, and it arouses great controversy in the school context. This way, the objective of this work was to promote a discussion about the use of mobile technologies in the study of the coastal ecosystems of Mata Atlantica with students of a public school of Marataizes / ES. As a source of data collection, bibliographical research was carried out in paper and virtual sources, through smartphones. In addition, a field lesson was organized in the coastal ecosystems of the Mata Atlantica located in the geo-school area, at which time mobile technologies acted as instruments to identify fauna and flora through the use of an application, in addition to serving the audiovisual record, later it was transformed into educational objects that were exposed to the school community. It was of great interes of the interest of the students to use mobile technologies in learning situations, which indicates the importance of the use of ICTs as educational tools, reinforcing the potential articulation of technological resources in the processes of teaching and learning in Sciences.

AB Learning of chemical formulation and nomenclature for university students is becoming less and less stimulating for first-course degree students, which further have marked deficiencies in both the initial level of knowledge and skill sets. As a consequence, this fact leads to motivational and interest problems for the subject, and more specifically, for the seminar classes. An initiative have been proposed which includes the use of a free mobile application (Socrative) to complete initial and final questionnaires, with the aim to improve the level of participation in the seminar classes of formulation, and to establish the bases for a new evaluation system. This work details the new followed methodology as well as the obtained results. The results show how the use of the application improves the marks in formulation and nomenclature, the class attendance, as well as that increment the student satisfaction for this type of teaching.

AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide facilities in teaching through education. There are many new tools and methodologies that use ICT as a knowledge-building support, but that are not always related to pedagogical practice. The Podcast is an important technology that can be used in the classroom. Using this tool, it can make the most interactive chemistry class, fleeing the classroom routine. However, it is necessary to point out that the podcast is just one feature that should be incorporated into education and not a substitute. This paper describes the development of Chemistry Podcasts by teachers and chemistry students in three disciplines in 2015. This study took place over a one-year period in a public University, in Pernambuco, Brazil. In the discipline of "Computer applied to the teaching of chemistry" participated 21 Chemistry teachers. In the disciplines of "Information and Communication Technologies in the teaching of chemistry" and "Informatics, Chemistry and Education" was composed of 54 undergraduate students in chemistry. Twelve podcasts were elaborated by students and five by teachers in this paper we present only nine. The results showed the contribution of podcasts produced by teachers and students in teaching and learning process chemistry.

AB Water systems planning and management share the same roots with gaming, as they rely on concepts in systems analysis, operations research and decision sciences. This paper focuses on Serious Games (those used for purposes other than mere entertainment), with applications in the area of water systems planning and management. A survey of published work on gaming is carried out with particular attention given to applications of Serious Gaming to water systems planning and management. The survey is also used to identify the principal criteria for the classification of Serious Gaming for water related applications, including application areas, goals, number and type of players, user interface, type of simulation model used, realism of the game, performance feedback, progress monitoring and game portability. The review shows that game applications in the water sector can be a valuable tool for making various stakeholders aware of the socio-techno-economic issues related to managing complex water systems. However, the critical review also indicates a gap that exists in the Serious Game application area with the lack of water distribution system games. A conceptually simple, but computationally elaborate new game for water distribution system analysis, design and evaluation (SeGWADE) is presented in this paper. It has a main goal of finding a least-cost design for a well-known benchmark problem, for which the game environment takes the computational and visualisation burden away from the simulation tool and the player. The game has been evaluated in a classroom environment in which a high degree of player engagement with the game was observed, due to its basic game ingredients and activities, i.e., challenge, play and fun. In addition, a clear improvement in learning has been observed in how players attempted to identify solutions that satisfy the pressure criterion with players readily identifying the proximity of the better solutions to the starting, infeasible configuration. Through applications of Serious Gaming such as this, decision makers can learn about the complexity of the water distribution system design problem, experiment safely using a computer model of a real system, understand conflicting objectives (i.e., minimization of cost and satisfaction of minimum pressure) and develop strategies for coping with complexity without being burdened by the limitations of the ICT technology at their disposal.

ID PROFESSIONS EDUCATION
AB Background: The School of Medicine (SoM) is one among five at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS). It currently houses eight undergraduate and many post-graduate programmes. The Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme reported herein is the oldest having ten semesters (5 years) followed by a 1 year compulsory rotatory internship at a hospital approved by the Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT). However, this training was largely knowledge-based and thus the need to shift towards competency-based education (CBE) and full modularization necessitated this study.
   Methods: A cross-sectional tracer study of MUHAS MD graduates from SoM who completed training between 2006 and 2008 was conducted using quantitative (structured interviewer-administered questionnaires) as well as qualitative methods [ In-depth questionnaire (IDI) and Focus group discussions (FGDs)].
   Results: A total of 147 MD graduates were traced and interviewed, representing 29 % of the 510 students who graduated from the SoM between 2006 and 2008. Majority (70.1 %, n = 103/147) were males. About 70 % graduated in 2008 and majority (68 %, n = 100/147) were doing internship. Majority (60.5 % n = 89/147) were based in/near Dar es Salaam at district, regional or referral hospitals. With reasonable concordance, most competencies ranked low except on four aspects. Teaching, System-based Practice and Good Practice had the lowest. Seminars/Tutorials, Laboratory Skills/Practicals, Theatre Skills, Outpatients clinics, Family Case Studies, Visits/Excursions and Self Reflection were rated less useful teaching methods compared to Lectures, Teaching Ward Rounds, Elective Studies, Field Work, Presentations, Continuous Assessments Tests, Final Examinations, Short Answers, Clinical/Practical Examinations. ICT and Library facilities were not considered to meet the students learning needs and Clinical Logbooks also ranked low. Teachers were generally ranked less favorably including in professional role-modelling and accessibility outside scheduled teaching sessions.
   Conclusions: This tracer study results allowed subsequent curriculum review and the introduction of full modularization and competency-based learning at MUHAS. It is envisioned that these tracer study findings will improve teaching, learning and inform next curriculum review at MUHAS leading to increased output of appropriately trained health professionals to fill the big gap in human resources for health (HRH) in Tanzania. The revised curricula are also being processed through TCU for accreditation as required.

AB This paper aims to address higher education students' learning space preferences. The study is based on a survey that involved 697 business management students of a Dutch University of Applied Sciences. The research focuses on preferred learning spaces for individual study activities, which require concentration, and preferred learning spaces for collaborative study activities with peers, which require communication. The results show that students consider their physical learning environment to be relevant and assume that learning spaces contribute to the outcome of their study activities. In contrast to the literature, the findings reveal that learning space preferences of students cannot substantially be attributed to behavioral aspects, such as their individual preference for privacy, interaction, and autonomy, nor to aspects of the physical environment related to the perceived relevance of comfort, aesthetics, ICT facilities, and layout. Student characteristics, such as gender, age, study year, or living situation, have a significant, but limited influence on the learning space preferences of students. Students mainly prefer learning spaces related to their learning activities. Students prefer learning space at home for individual activities. For collaborative study activities with peers, they prefer learning space at the university. Public spaces are not popular for study activities. Overall, students particularly prefer quiet learning spaces with the possibility to retreat as an individual or as a small group. Apparently, learning space preferences are more related to perceived effectiveness rather than to experience value. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the guidelines of the Strategy for Education Development in Serbia 2020 implies the implementation of modern ICTs onto teaching and learning methods of both existing and newly developed study programs pertaining to higher education area.
   The Faculty of Philology of the University of Belgrade, being a highly reputable and prestigious higher education institution and cherishing a long tradition in education and research in the field of language, literature and culture, strives to continuously and increasingly develop its study programs by introducing ICTs at all levels of study. Our main objective is to enhance language, literature and culture teaching and learning experience throughout blended learning. Namely, the Faculty of Philology offers, within its Moodle platform, the wealth of courses concerning different languages, literatures and cultures, as well as those belonging to social sciences (e.g. courses in developmental and educational psychology). In this way, we intend to provide our students the opportunity of acquiring comprehensive knowledge in the field of philology, literary science, cultural studies and social sciences in general, the kind of education which is indeed required of the modern age man. We also took into account the fact that the use of digital technologies is becoming prevalent in a number of learning processes and that, hence, their implementation is invaluable particularly in the field of higher education. The Faculty of Philology is extremely proud of the learning content to be found on the faculty's Moodle platform, and of the fact that it is becoming richer and more diverse every year. Courses on the undergraduate level of studies are currently divided in 20 subgroups out of 38 study groups, which involve the following: Serbian Language and Literature, Serbian Literature and Language with Comparative Studies, General Literature and Theory of Literature, General Linguistics, Library and Information Science, fourteen different languages or language groups (such as for example Scandinavian languages), as well as Seminar of Social Sciences. Each of these subgroups offers a variety of courses, which all together constitute a rich repository of knowledge in the field of philology, literary science and cultural studies. At the MA level of studies, the courses offered on the faculty's Moodle platform within Language, Literature, Culture study program include over forty different subjects. We are currently working diligently as to offer the variety of high quality learning contents within the relatively new MA study program Cultures in Dialogue in a blended learning format. For now, the contents are available for the courses Encounter of Civilizations and Elements of Western Civilization. As for the courses belonging to Language, Literature, Culture study program at the PhD level of studies, these also include a vast number of courses on all three modules. In this paper, we intend to emphasize as to how far we have come in placing learning contents onto the faculty's Moodle platform and the implications that this variety of content will have on educating future philologists in Serbia, who will, hence, gain more comprehensive knowledge than ever before in the field of philology and humanities and social sciences in general.

Among these resources are infographics since, according to some researchers, allow the appropriation of knowledge by processing, organization and prioritization of new information while clarifying his thought (Jonassen, 2000), so it was considered, they are a medium that can contribute to potentiate the learning of natural sciences students, and in turn they are able to teach others. The study universe of this research are students of the third year of the morning Graduate School of the Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Puebla registered in the area of natural sciences and health, the 2014-2015 school year, making a comparative cross with a pilot group and another where the resource wasn't used. Later, the results are displayed. To measure and assess their scope, two instruments: a questionnaire where students from third pilot group evaluate themselves and a survey of second-year students from the same school who were advised. The conclusions that can be reached after analyzing the results, show the potential in the process of teaching and learning of various subjects of natural sciences and health, as long as they are well crafted.

AB Research on the efficacy of ICT-based teaching methods in improving generic skills in addition to content skills among future workforce is increasing. Accordingly, this study investigates the impact of e-learning on creativity and content knowledge of chemistry students at the Payame Noor University of Hamedan, Iran. The study used the pre-test/post-test experimental design with a control group. The statistical population of the study included was 100 pure chemistry students who were following two separate classes. Forty students were selected from this group who placed in the experimental group (n = 20) and the control group (n = 20). Two instruments were used for data collection; a specifically developed test on the Introduction to Chemistry course and the Abedi Inventory for assessing creativity. Results of data analysis using the independent t-test (aided by SPSS) demonstrated statistically significantly higher scores for the experimental group on measured variables, knowledge and creativity. Therefore, it is concluded that e-learning is effective for knowledge and creativity acquisitions among chemistry students and the greater e-learning opportunities should be provided for wider audiences.

The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (TIC) in University teaching processes may enable the development of new training and educational experiences, performing activities integrated into the teaching process. In this paper the use of a teaching methodology based on Moodle platform to perform on-line activities in the subjects of Analytical Chemistry I and II of the Degree in Pharmacy of the Complutense University of Madrid is described. In order to improve student participation, to correct the weaknesses of the methodology implemented and to know the willingness, students were surveved regarding the introduction of other innovative tools in the Analytical Chemistry course. A regular use of the available tools was made by students and also they rated positively these activities. However, they had low predisposition to include new TIC in the classroom, such as Wiki spaces and the e-portfolio.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a didactic proposal for teaching with simulations (DPTS) and analyze the conditions and didactic moments that accompany its implementation for students of the professorate in Biological Sciences. Thus, it is intended to facilitate the learning of disciplinary content and its didactics, and the acquisition of autonomy in the use of technological resources by future professors. The Forensic EA Lite simulation, a software designed for addressing contents of molecular evolution, was used. Molecular evolution is one of the program units of the subject "Molecular Genetics" in which this proposal was carried out. DPTS was designed, implemented, adjusted through practice and finally resulted in the following didactic moments: presentation, program exploration and appropriation of specific vocabulary, articulation between simulation and disciplinary content, correlation activities, time for metacognition and time for content transfer (enforcement activities). Difficulties and benefits of the proposal for learning the subject, acquisition of autonomy with the technological resource and contributions for teacher training were evaluated. The development and adjustment of the proposal were focused on both didactic decisions made by the teacher to design and put into practice a didactic sequence of the simulation used and on the learning demands of students, in a process of continuous feedback. The proposal facilitated learning of the molecular basis of evolution, made the students exercise autonomy when using technological resources, and provided a form of didactic intervention to teach with simulations in theoretical constructivist frameworks for the practice teachers in training in biology.

AB Peer interaction and collaborative learning through the use of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is used to an increasing extent in higher education. Universities attempt to motivate learners (students) to support their peers to enhance the quality of learning outcomes. This study monitors how an ICTSS (ICT-based Support System) facilitates peer interaction in the Bachelor's and Master's thesis process. The aim of the study was to investigate learners' perception of usefulness of an ICTSS for peer interaction and the influencing factors on the quality of the peer interaction. The ICTSS was developed at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV), at Stockholm University. The system facilitates peer interaction in three ways: peer reviews, active participation, and final opposition. The study employed a mixed-method approach, which included an online survey followed by in-depth interviews. The target groups were learners at the Bachelor's and Master's level in computer science and information systems. The findings showed that learners perceived the peer interaction useful to enhance the quality of the thesis outcomes. However, there are influencing factors affecting the quality of peer interaction, in different phases of the thesis process. Examples of these factors are the quality of thesis manuscripts, supervisors' control and grading, clear instructions and guidelines, learners' understanding of the peer interaction and why it takes place, previous training, and learners' motivation to perform peer reviews. Following these factors, the study developed a set of strategic suggestions from both pedagogical and technical aspects to enhance the peer interaction in the thesis process. Considering these suggestions makes the use of the ICTSS more effective to enhance the quality of thesis learning outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on technological advances, new features have contributed to improved communication and dissemination of information and, therefore, have been used as teaching tools. These tools such as computer, videos, Internet, blogs and other Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) are called Information and Communications Technologies, or popularly ICTs. In order to discuss the contribution of ICTs in the chemistry teaching, this work used the VLE in a qualitative analytical chemistry classroom teaching of Federal University of Esprito Santo. Using features found in AVA, were made available during the course, articles for reading, exercises with answers, video lectures, support materials, videos and forums to present a multiplicity in the way with which scientific knowledge would be shared, besides to facilitate understanding this knowledge. As a result, there was a positive class participation in AVA (171 entry per student during the course), added to opinions of students that the use of AVA in the classroom teaching can help chemistry learning process. In the end, it is clear that ICTs can collaborate with chemistry teaching and their potential should be further explored.

AB This research work is done in the context of university teaching to approach with teaching and learning aspects in a health sciences clinical level to grade students. The purpose is analyzing teaching roles, at the first blended learning course form on Medicine School, inside virtual learning space of Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay in 2008.
   This analysis explores the ways to teach in a virtual environment, in the form of mentoring of teachers acting as well as a new figure, the student tutor (peer tutor).
   Methodology used was a qualitative study of teachers and peer's tutors interventions in the virtual course, semi-structured interviews were conducted to teachers and some group of peers tutors. The issues that were explored are: how to construct the tutor role in a virtual environment, the technological context influence, the functions in the tutorial tasks, the construction to the interpersonal interaction with technological intermediation, and the relationship between tutor and contents through teaching of clinical reasoning.
   Conclusions allow us to say that distance education permits us to develop the virtual peer tutor and reprofile teacher figure. All participants were quickly adapted to technology. That fact did possible the creation of a new method in a virtual model, allowing the reproduction of clinical problems solving, in collective construction as the same way the current teaching does. Tutors assume the teacher's role, and these facts improve themselves learning and made better understanding of the process of learning.
   We think that this research provides inputs for the development and improvement of tutorial figure and use of ICT in higher education, also suggests lines for future research in this field.

DE Virtual Learning Environments; Moodle; Lesson of Moodle
AB In the last years, the Information and Communication Technologies have made possible the appearance of interactive spaces between teacher and students. A vast number of e-learning systems are developed to achieve this interaction. Among all of the Virtual Learning Environments, (VLEs), the most outstanding is the management platform of educational content Moodle. Moodle contains a wide range of activity modules that can be used to build up any type of course. In particular, in this paper we will focus on the use of Lesson module in Moodle in teaching Organic Chemistry. We have prepared two Lessons of Moodle for the subject "Organic Chemistry I" in the second year of the Degree in Chemistry about "Functional group interconversion by nucleophilic substitution" and "Nucleophilic substitution reactions involving formation of new C-C bonds". Lesson of Moodle is an interesting, flexible and interactive way to show the students different topics of a subject, where they read some content, and after that, they have to answer some questions. Based on the answers the student gives, the system sends him/her to another page in the Lesson.

DE Blended learning; language learning; student engagement
AB In Finland, universities of applied sciences offer entire study programmes for students with blended or distance learning approach. Especially adult students prefer blended learning studying since it allows them to combine their work, studies and family life; therefore the courses are designed to have contact teaching approximately once a month, otherwise the teaching and learning is implemented by ICT.
   Language teaching utilizes websites and different virtual learning platforms which enable distance learning and individual studying as well as mobile learning not depending on time or place. However, in designing and implementing courses based on blended learning approach the teacher should pay special attention to student engagement since on a traditional contact teaching course students tend to finish their studies more compared to blended learning courses.
   This article presents versatile tools, assignment types and best practices related to student engagement on blended learning language courses. The intention is to create meaningful, pedagogically motivated, all language competences covering blended learning courses, the emphasis being on promoting learning to offer positive and efficient learning experiences by engaging students.
   Student engagement is achieved through positive self-assessment, guidance towards self-regulated learning, encouragement towards tolerant learning atmosphere, peer assignments, and partly self-paced as well as collaborative learning. Furthermore application such as Padlet, Kahoot, Voxopop and Shadow Puppet promote student engagement. Technological solutions offer a great deal, but teacher role is essential as a facilitator on a balanced blended learning course.

DE Didactic of the Sciences; History of Science; Biographies; Social
   Networks; Role-Playing; Role-Taking; Twitter
AB Since the introduction of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) Spanish universities have improved the use of ICT and the development of Web 2.0 as a communication channel and a means of contextualizing the process of teaching-learning and training students who work in a comparative way. In this way, Twitter has become an important resource in education, and is currently rated as the best tool for learning by a broad sector of professionals.
   In this work we present a teaching-learning experience which has been performed using the biography of scientists in Twitter and techniques that vary between role-playing and role-taking intended for university students. It was carried out in the framework of the area of History of Science to implement transversal competences as well as basic and general competencies, as part of the Degree in Medicine (2nd year) at the University of Extremadura.
   To get started, students enrolled in the subject of History of Medicine and Bioethics created on Twitter the profile of an important scientist. As a starting point a previous analysis on "who's who in the History of Medicine" was done and a number of relevant historical figures (n=43) lower than the number of students enrolled in the course (n=133) were selected to generate a greater complexity in the coordination of interactions that might arise. Students had to develop certain bibliographic searches of a complexity that depended on the author that each student had been randomly assigned. After an analysis of the corresponding scientist, the students narrated his/her life in 1st person tweets. While maintaining scientific rigour, they were encouraged to create the biography with creativity and intelligent humour.
   Tweets developed to perform the work were:
   a) The date and place of birth of the scientist.
   b) The historical context of the society in which he/she lived, and description of his/her personal life.
   c) His/her scientific training and studies.
   d) The post and the place where he/she developed his/her interests.
   e) His/her work.
   f) Events that marked his/her life, both at the family level and as a professional or the historical moment in which he/she lived.
   g) The social and cultural impact of the character, that is to say, the impact or mark of his/her work or thought.
   h) The date and place of death.
   Of the 133 students enrolled in the subject only 115 completed the activity. A simple statistical analysis of transversal descriptive type of the tweets made shows an arithmetical average (mu) of 25.08 with a standard deviation (sigma) of 16.97 and a median of 21. Students almost unanimously described the activity as innovative, dynamic, original, interesting and fun, and said that it requires dedication and constant effort by facilitating the development of the programme in a simple and pleasant mode. In conclusion, the degree of satisfaction of the teachers and students involved in this experience has been high, although it has not been exempt from the difficulties of connectivism and constructivist learning.

DE TIC competence; Virtual classroom; Educational platform
ID RESOURCES; ICT
AB Global technological progress influences society in many areas, including education. Specialists debating on the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education, agree on the necessity to look for new methodological approaches that may improve learning and teaching at every level. The adequate utilization of ICT is understood as intricately related procedures that help to keep docents always updated and are in general support of the learning and teaching process (UNESC0 2008). In this work, we describe the strategies that have been applied to build up a virtual classroom to be used for theoretical and laboratory sessions within the Cellular and Tissular Biology subject (BCT I), from the Chemistry Pharmacology and Biology curricula (QFB) in the Faculty for Higher Studies Zaragoza (FES-Z), UNAM. To this end, we have used the Moodle platform, located in the Department for on line and distant education (DELID) at the FES-Z. In order to define the required contents, we started consulting teachers for their opinions, needs and suggestions. This became later a permanent workshop where we analyse all statistics that are registered in the platform and discuss the topics that may be added, deleted or updated. We are also developing an instrument that will allow us to analyse how the users, both teachers and students, perceive their experiences. The feedback will be also used afterwards to modify and improve the virtual classroom. At the moment, we are already giving courses to teachers with the purpose to improve their pedagogic skills and prepare them for a proper use of TIC and additional tools. Our aim is to secure a quality education (Peres 2009), with the participation of knowledgeable teachers, capable of using TIC and developing pedagogic skills in benefit of their students (Castells 2002). A project like this, which must be continuously renewed, constitutes a big challenge for teachers well aware of their needs for keeping themselves always updated (MartIn-Laborda, 2005).

DE didactical toolbox; internet technology; network design; IPv6 migration
AB The introduction of the IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) protocol was carried out hesitantly in Austrian organizations for many years. But lately, a growing number of Austrian companies and organizations are planning or starting a migration to a dual-stack IPv4 / IPv6 network. As a consequence, many IT jobs require a deeper understanding of IPv6 technology. Students in the field of ICT (information and communication technology) must be prepared with knowledge in this area.
   A rich set of experiences from successful implementations in the networks of different companies and organizations is available now. In order to collect this domain-specific knowledge systematically and make it available in an appropriate form for technology students, concepts, strategies and tools for designing IPv6 networks and migrating from IPv4 to IPv6 were selected and transformed into a "didactical toolbox".
   In this paper, we present the most important results from this project in form of the "IPv6 net: force! Toolbox". The main technology topics are IPv6 readiness, network and subnetwork design and specifics of dual-stack networks. The contents of these areas are based on recommendations and best practices of the relevant organizations such as the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), RIPE NCC (RIPE Network Coordination Centre) and BSI (Bundesamt fur Sicherheit in der Infomationstechnik), and industry leaders (Cisco, Microsoft, Solarwinds.).
   IPv6 readiness includes testing all network components for their support of IPv6. A very important prerequisite to any IPv6 migration is the network personnel's knowhow about the new possibilities and chances for not only implementing everything "in the same way" as with IPv4 before, but enhancing/developing a modern subnet structure, security concept, using automation possibilities etc. when migrating to IPv6. In this scenario the "IPv6 net: force! Toolbox" can be used for professional training and practicing as well.
   Additionally the evaluation of IP address management software is included, all tested tools performed sufficiently in IPv4 examples but did not meet a number of requirements for IPv6 networks.
   Based on this collection, example scenarios are presented which are used to demonstrate many of the important new concepts and possibilities. These scenarios are implemented in a network simulator and with these simulation scenarios we could verify the correctness and suitability of the proposed methods. The simulation scenarios now build the core of the didactical toolbox. Students can use the concept and best practice summaries and descriptions e.g. during teacher-guided or self-study learning activities. Especially for lab-oriented or problem based learning courses there are benefits when the low-overhead and easy to use "IPv6 net: force! Toolbox" simulation scenarios are available.
   Using the "IPv6 net: force! Toolbox" in a number of courses in one of the largest universities of applied sciences in Austria, it was possible for students to work in "hands-on" lab sessions with the simulation scenarios. The students learn to understand important IPv6 design benefits and handle new challenges when practicing the correct configuration of network components-especially routers and firewalls - and try out different configurations in a realistic manner without the overhead of a complex real test network.

DE Neuroeducation; Media education; videogames ICT; innovative teaching
   methodologies
AB The reflections contained in this research work deal with the educational challenge launched by Neuroeducation theory and the other cultural and social phenomenon of videogames, which have become more than pure forms of entertainment and fun, more and more metaphors of the big game of the reality of life.
   Many studies say that video game play is beginning to threaten traditional home entertainment choices (especially television), posing a very real threat to other media revenue streams.
   The reasons for video games growth in sales and popularity can be credited to the growth in the popularity and the technical innovations in the mobile sector.
   Attempting to support videogames for education and learning purposes has prompted considerable attention over the last years. The great variety of digital games available has provided much for educators and researchers to explore, resulting in intense disputes that many games have benefits both in and out of the classroom for learners of primary school.
   Video games were developed with a double mission: to stimulate the extraordinary, but also the ordinary. Videogames present a new form of amusement which has put the classical model of playing into crisis, where the dimensions of space and time have to be clear and defined beforehand. Moreover, videogames personalize the use of media since they transform each one to become a solitary actor in the communicative context.
   Starting from the construction of a Form for the Neuroeducation Analysis of Videogames (FNAV), the present work aims at analyzing videogame products in order to learn how to think critically and to become aware of their intelligence profile and cognitive style. From an educational point of view, the data presented are meant to be functional tools to stimulate thinking activity and to activate appropriate neural processes in children. The research dealt with the analysis of 50 video games designed for children aged 3 to 10 years of age. The FNAVs have been built by 162 university students attending the Degree Course in Educational Sciences, 3rd year, at the University of Palermo, in the period October-Novembrer 2015.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; STUDENTS
AB One of the guidelines of the Strategy for Education Development in Serbia 2020 implies the implementation of modern ICTs onto teaching and learning methods of both existing and newly developed study programs pertaining to higher education area. The Faculty of Philology of the University of Belgrade, being a highly reputable and prestigious higher education institution and cherishing a long tradition in education and research in the field of language, literature and culture, strives to continuously and increasingly develop its study programs by introducing ICTs at all levels of study. Our main objective is to enhance language, literature and culture teaching and learning experience throughout blended learning. Namely, the Faculty of Philology offers, within its Moodle platform, the wealth of courses concerning different languages, literatures and cultures, as well as those belonging to social sciences (e.g. courses in developmental and educational psychology). In this way, we intend to provide our students the opportunity of acquiring comprehensive knowledge in the field of philology, literary science, cultural studies and social sciences in general, the kind of education which is indeed required of the modern age man. We also took into account the fact that the use of digital technologies is becoming prevalent in a number of learning processes and that, hence, their implementation is invaluable particularly in the field of higher education.
   The Faculty of Philology is extremely proud of the learning content to be found on the faculty's Moodle platform, and of the fact that it is becoming richer and more diverse every year. Courses on the undergraduate level of studies are currently divided in 20 subgroups out of 38 study groups, which involve the following: Serbian Language and Literature, Serbian Literature and Language with Comparative Studies, General Literature and Theory of Literature, General Linguistics, Library and Information Science, fourteen different languages or language groups (such as for example Scandinavian languages), as well as Seminar of Social Sciences. Each of these subgroups offers a variety of courses, which all together constitute a rich repository of knowledge in the field of philology, literary science and cultural studies. At the MA level of studies, the courses offered on the faculty's Moodle platform within Language, Literature, Culture study program include over forty different subjects. We are currently working diligently as to offer the variety of high quality learning contents within the relatively new MA study program Cultures in Dialogue in a blended learning format. For now, the contents are available for the courses Encounter of Civilizations and Elements of Western Civilization. As for the courses belonging to Language, Literature, Culture study program at the PhD level of studies, these also include a vast number of courses on all three modules. In this paper, we intend to emphasize as to how far we have come in placing learning contents onto the faculty's Moodle platform and the implications that this variety of content will have on educating future philologists in Serbia, who will, hence, gain more comprehensive knowledge than ever before in the field of philology and humanities and social sciences in general.

DE Mediated activities; information and communication technologies;
   learning; undergraduates
AB This work aims to analyze the uses of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices, ICT-mediated activities in which undergraduates participate, the importance of ICT in learning and their relationship to the different areas of college careers studied. From the perspective of social constructivists and learning as situated, we consider ICT as cultural artifacts present in social practices, which, by their characteristics, expand learning opportunities, as they not only provide fast access to information and communication, but also integrate a set of tools that support the individual in moving their learning interests from one context to another. An intentional non-probabilistic sample consisting of 400 undergraduates from a Brazilian public university participated in the study, from technical and humanities degrees with modalities of both face-to-face teaching and distance education. The data was collected through a structured questionnaire and was analyzed with the use of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, v. 20). The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U Test was applied to compare the two samples made up of students in technical and humanities degrees and evaluate the significant differences with regard to data. Significant differences between students of technical and humanities degrees have been verified with regard to the use of ICT devices, ICTmediated activities and their importance in learning.

DE Innovation; teaching methodology; undergraduate
AB This article aimed to identify the teaching strategies used by Professor-Team segment of undergraduate courses at a Brazilian Public University and typifies them according to the teaching methods used in: individual, socialized and socio-individualized. In addition, it tried to identify the resources most used by teachers working in different areas of knowledge. The study was conducted with the identification and analysis of teaching strategies and resources present in abstracts published in a collection of Teaching Methodologies (http://www.unesp.br/portal#!/prograd/e-livros-prograd). The texts were organized and classified in three areas of knowledge: Humanity, Biological and Exact. Within each area were identified and analyzed the methodological aspects in practical educational proposal or developed. Were evaluated 25 abstracts of Humanity, 12 of Exact and 23 of Biological areas, in a total of 60 abstracts. Both in Biological Sciences as Humanities areas the professors preferred to use socialized or socio-individualized methods to teach the subjects contents and used the method individualized but with a lower prevalence. In the Exact Area the socio-individualized were the most frequent method reported (75%), followed by individual teaching practice (25%), without occurrence of using socialized method. In Humanities, the teaching strategies with the highest prevalence were reading texts, study of the environment, play activities, awareness and discussions with significant occurrence of Project Based Learning methodology (PBL). Prior reading, visits, case studies, reflective journals, portfolios and PBL have been widely used in Life Sciences. In the field of Exact Sciences the most common strategies were the production of objects, drawings and PBL. The information and communication technologies (ICT) were predominantly used in the Exact Area, restricted to the use of software and digital production figures. In Biological Area were used videos, virtual learning environment (VLE), social media and image scanning software. The use of ICT in the humanities was less frequent than in other areas, restricting the use of social networking and the VLE. The interdisciplinary approach was used most frequently by teachers of Biological courses, followed by those in the Humanities area. There were no reported interdisciplinary experiences in the Exact area. It can be concluded that the reports presented to the composition of this collection demonstrate the use of various teaching methodologies and strategies, with a prevalence of some types within the same field of knowledge, reflecting the appreciation of social interaction and socio-individualized practices among professors who teach contents of Biological Science and Humanity. In the Exact Sciences there was no occurrence of socialized methods.

DE UDIMA; New Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); quality;
   higher education
AB Teacher training in higher education stands as one of the keys and most representative factors to achieve quality education. Thus, training courses intended for university professors are one of the basic pillars on which the continuous improvement of university education is settled. In this regard, it is relevant that, today, higher education takes place in completely new contexts and environments. Furthermore, these scenarios are changing, so education must be effectively adapted to them in the same way. From this initial standpoint, this work's main priority is to provide an overview of the teacher training courses currently designed by different universities. A special emphasis will be laid on the challenging goal that UDIMA has taken by supporting its teaching and learning methodologies new Information and Communication Technologies, while keeping a student-focused approach. The Madrid Open University (UDIMA) is one of the highest quality teaching options within the broad higher education community in Spain.
   With this paper, the authors, Mercedes Raquel Garcia Revilla, professor of Business and Tourist Activities and Work Sciences, and Richard Mababu Mukiur, professor of Human Resources and Labor Relations, intend to accomplish a quantitative and descriptive methodology, whose main sources of information have been provided by the University. The aim is to analyze this information and thereupon reflect it on its courses (in various existing categories) targeted at teachers, in order to explain why UDIMA may be considered a model for quality education.
   The main findings of this ongoing investigation let us conclude that there is a significant diversity of topics in UDIMA's training proposal for its employees (languages, computers, etc.), which ultimately benefits the offer of quality education for the university's students.

DE End-of-Degree project; competence assessment; transversal competences
AB With the process of convergence towards the European Space for Higher Education (ESHE), a new subject, known as End-of-Degree Project (EDP), has emerged after the introduction of new degree study plans. This implies that all undergraduate students must enrol in this subject to complete their study plan and also for the competences associated to each degree to be assessed. With this in mind, the aim of this research is to describe and compare the competences undergraduates reading Preschool and Primary Education develop with respect to those of Sport Sciences and Physical Education. The present document includes a sectional and descriptive study of a sample of 119 pupils who have completed and defended their End-of-Degree Project (EDP) in the Faculty of Education Sciences and Sport in the academic year 2014-2015. The pilot study analyses the level of acquisition of a number of transversal competences: "capacity for criticism and self-criticism"; "teamwork abilities"; "oral communication"; "learning to learn"; "creativity"; "excellence habits and quality in the exercise of the profession"; "capacity to understand scientific literature"; and "ICT management", which students report they have reached in the process of completing and defending their EDP. To this end, Student's t-test for independent samples was carried out. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS version 20.0. The level of significance was set at 5% (p<0.05) for all tests. The results of the study confirm that students consider that completing their EDP contributes to transversal competence achievement to a high degree, with the possible exception of "teamwork abilities", whose assessment results are lower than other variables. Additionally, there are statistical differences between the degrees for the "learning to learn" and "ICT management" competences. We may conclude that the EDP develops transversal competences both in Preschool and Primary Education undergraduates and Sports Science and Education undergraduates.

DE Education; Scratch software; Involvement; Special Needs Education
AB This study aims to contribute to the participation of children with Special Educational Needs (SEN), particularly in classes on Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and to design a teaching resource supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that is suitable for classroom use by students with SEN.
   It is essential to use ICT as a teaching tool that can overcome barriers to student learning, and that provides an interactive environment, involvement and motivation in the process of teaching and learning of students with SEN [1]. There are advantages in using ICT with SEN students, since its use can improve the performance efficiency of these students in tasks, reducing disabilities and disadvantages and increasing their academic and social integration [2].
   Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab and it is available online [3]. Scratch allows to program stories, games and interactive animations, and share creations online. Using sound, animations, image and text, among others, allows students to stay more alert and motivated.
   This paper presents two case studies carried out by two different teachers in their classroom during the current school year. The participants in each case study were: (i) three 4th grade students with Dyslexia diagnosis; (ii) three students (two were in the 6th grade and one in the 9th grade) with Intellectual Disability diagnosis.
   Activities using Scratch software were designed and implemented, namely about "The importance of water for living beings" and "Pollution and Recycling". The study was guided by the following research questions (RQ): (RQ1) Is Using Scratch suitable and feasible in the daily work of students with SEN? (RQ2) To what extent can Scratch contribute to a better involvement of students with SEN in the suggested tasks?
   Data was collected through the analysis of the students Individual Educational Programs, an interview with the Special Education teacher, audio recording, photographs, tasks and notations made by the research teacher. The data analysis was mainly qualitative. Results revealed how students interacted with Scratch and showed that using this programming language can engage students with SEN in the process of learning.
   The data collected in this study sustains the idea that it's possible to work with the educational software Scratch with students with Special Educational Needs. It enabled a higher level of participation and autonomy of the students when carrying tasks related to Natural Sciences and Mathematics curricular topics.

DE skills; competencies; learning; experiences
AB In the past decade, education and technology merged in their effort to offer the best learning experience one can get. The outstanding ICT progress allowed new developments in delivering learning materials and supporting learning process to become student-centred. Exploring new teaching methods and developing new learning ecosystem, more engaging and user friendly, became a challenging goal to be achieved for universities and also for IT companies oriented toward education. Today more than ever, universities should reshape their educational offer being more engaged in developing study programs oriented toward the future needs of the labour market. Actually today we suppose to build skills and competencies to our students in order to meet the professions of the future. Teacher's role in education is changing rapidly, from traditional knowledge transfer to partnership in learning, teachers and students are engaged in discovering new ways to knowledge acquiring and applying. The goal of a modern teachers should be to provide to his students the ability to acquire new knowledge and the capacity to solve real problems using digital opportunities.
   In this context was implemented an 18 months project - Adapt2jobs (www.adapt2jobs.ro). This project started in May 2014 and ended in November 2015, being a European-funded project, with a view to adapting teaching methods and academic curricula to the labour-market demands.
   Working together with IT specialists, our project experts, teachers from three domains: Economics, Social Sciences and Art & Architecture, have developed a new learning environment. Knowledge transfer occurred via digitized content, students being encouraged to discover how concepts are linked to the methods/techniques that make them applicable in the real life. The project aims to develop the following competencies: critical thinking, problem solving, mastering new software, improving communication skills. A significant part of the project's implementation was to test the students' performances that have accepted to enrol and to use the facilities provide by the new learning ecosystem. A secondary objective established was to improve students' responsibility in managing the own learning process. In order to evaluate the project impact and to measure the student's performances a set of surveys were designed mainly to gather relevant data about student's experience, students' assessments results and to collect student's improvement suggestions. The paper aims to present the surveys' results which link the project outcomes to students' experience and to introduce new developments of the Adapt2jobs learning ecosystem. The project sustainability is important for us therefore a strategy was designed and we have start looking for appropriate resources to be implemented.

DE didactical toolbox; internet technology; network programming
AB Acquiring an in-depth understanding of internet technology is one important goal for ICT students. Software development skills are another aspect with high relevance when it comes to professional skills. In our approach, these two factors are combined into one didactical tool, which can be used in different learning scenarios and for undergraduate as well as graduate level courses.
   In this paper we present the general architecture, some implementation aspects and the usability test phase of our "net: force! Snippet Toolbox" (NST). The NST was implemented for students in the Information Management (business informatics) degree programme at FH JOANNEUM University of Applied Sciences. It is designed to support different courses in the subject area of basic and advanced internet technology, network programming, IT security, and related topic areas.
   The idea of an easy start into network programming also for beginners in this area led to the usage of MediaWiki for documentation and user guides. Two virtual server machines are used for hosting all NST services as well as for supporting the client-server examples. Access to the snippet server is implemented with the "Shell In A Box" tool, and the development environment is kept as simple as possible, e.g. recommending the "nano" editor for the students.
   A number of examples (called "snippets") which fit the curriculum of our Information Management course have been collected for the NST. The samples cover a wide range from a first experience with network programming (client - server socket programming, ping, traceroute, etc.) up to advanced topics in the network security area (network sniffer, "hacking tool"). These examples were then implemented on a server so that students can employ them in a user-friendly way. The Python as well as the Java programming languages have deliberately been chosen for these examples, because they are relatively easy-to-learn programming languages. All exercises have been didactically prepared and provided for use in the MediaWiki interface. The flexible and simple concept makes it easy to use the snippets toolbox also on a Banana Pi single board credit card sized computer. It is possible to implement some advanced security examples (e.g. a WLAN scanner tool) with this extension to the concept.
   Using NST, students are motivated to find the solution to the individual examples. The combination of programming and understanding important terms in the field of network technology is a proven concept to let students gain cross-functional knowledge and skills.
   In addition to development and preparation of the toolbox environment and examples, a key point was a usability test which was performed to find didactical errors of the toolbox, enhance easy accessibility, and prepare it for future developments. Thus, the "net: force! Snippet Toolbox" was subjected to a usability test with five students. The results made it possible to show that the "net: force! Snippet Toolbox" has high potential for future use in the context of higher education in ICT courses. The current state of the NST shows the way towards a universal toolbox when it comes to the topic of network programming.

DE Environmental Education; meaningful learning; values; museology;
   CmapTools; webquest; m-learning
AB In recent decades mankind has come to realise that the current development model has adverse effects on the environment. Environmental education (EE) promotes an education based on values related with knowledge and respect for environment. Theory of meaningful learning is acknowledged as base to promote the learning in educational process. One of the most interesting inputs for EE purposes was Novak's "theory of education" (1977, 1990, 1998), proposing teaching techniques that build on the meaningful language theory (Ausubel, 1968). This article summarizes the result of an investigation project in which knowledge of EE, meaningful learning and museology within the framework of Natural Science Museum of University of Navarra has been applied. As a result, a didactic unit of formal education has been proposed. It is aimed at 11-12 years old children to promote the learning of "respect" value and the meaning of biodiversity through a visit to the museum and using learning tools such as conceptual maps. These tools are developed with CmapTools, webquest and m-learning applications linked with new information and communication technologies.

AB The University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) was founded in 2002 (http://www.uoit.ca/). Located in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, the university was founded with a specific mission, namely to address a shortage of highly qualified personnel in areas of health sciences, engineering, science, management and information technology disciplines. Since its first class in 2003, the university has grown to include over 9700 undergraduate students and 500 graduate students in a variety of programs (49 undergraduate programs; 17 Masters programs; and 7 PhD programs).
   A founding feature of UOIT was the design, implementation and evaluation of a Technology Enriched Learning Environment (TELE). This innovative program was fundamental to both the brand of the university and its academic programs. The TELE program (http://itsc.uoit.ca/teaching_learning/technology-enriched-learning/) embraced the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in all aspects of teaching and learning as well as the integration of ICT into curriculum design. Today, TELE continues to be the largest program of its kind in North America.
   The pillars of the program include: provision of a new laptop computer for each student; a bi-annual hardware refresh to ensure learners have access to up-to-date hardware and technologies, similar to those used in future employment settlings; course-specific software pre-loaded on each computer to support course and program learning outcomes; integration of the online learning environment including an LMS as well as collaborative software for real-time interaction; and importantly, a belief that a ubiquitous ICT learning environment was best managed centrally to ensure lower costs to students. These foundational beliefs were based on the computing environment of the early millennium characterised by the high cost of rapidly evolving hardware and software with few alternatives; lack of consumer cloud computing; and the requirement for specialized knowledge to manage personal computing environments.
   In 2015, the currency of TELE program at UOIT was questioned based on a re-examination of the program tenants. The growth of mobile devices, lower costs of laptop hardware, cloud computing affordances, changing software requirements, student desire for greater hardware choice, the growth of low cost online alternatives to centralized computing services and enhanced abilities by the university to monitor individual usage patterns, together established the rationale for evolving Canada's largest ICT program. To inform this evolution and the resultant programmatic changes, four questions were posed?
   These included:
   a) What is the sense of how well TELE has met the needs of faculty and students?;
   b) What are the unfulfilled needs of students and faculty?;
   c) What constraints are there to changing TELE?; and
   d) What new and emerging technologies support transformation?
   This presentation addresses these strategic questions based primarily on survey and institutional data and will outline the next phase of technology enabled learning at UOIT.

DE models; projection; science education; 3D projections; interactive
   models
AB PISA study has defined several key areas to be paid attention to by teachers. One of these areas is work with models. The term model can be understood very broadly, it can refer to a drawing of a chemical reaction, a plastic model, a permanent mount (taxidermy) to advanced 3D projections. Teachers are no longer confined to teaching materials and aids available physically at schools. Thanks to information technology, models can be included in lessons almost without any limits. However, work with models is very specific due to the simple fact that a model always differs from what it represents. Efficiency of education using ICT can be affected negatively in case that work with complex models requires high level of abstraction which pupils are not capable of (Harrison, Treagust, 2000). Jancarikova (2015) points out that - due to the demands on upper secondary pupils - children must be taught how to relate models to real objects from very early stages. Linking an object to its model - isomorphism is the basis for successful work with models. Work with models thus must be developed systematically and consistently and included into teaching of younger learners. The scope of work with models in natural sciences is gradually increasing. There are some phenomena that are ungraspable without a model, e.g. DNA double helix. However, the fact that we are able to project these models to pupils using information technology does not mean that pupils will be able to understand them. In this paper we want to point out that not enough attention is paid to work with models (not only in the Czech Republic) - methodology of work with models does not exist and is not taught to pre-service teachers. The paper classifies types of models we come across in lessons, describes basic differences between objects and reality they represent and proposes possible ways of systematic inclusion of models into teaching

AB There is increasing recognition of the role eHealth will play in the effective and efficient delivery of healthcare. This research challenges the assumption that students enter university as digital natives, able to confidently and competently adapt their use of information and communication technology (ICT) to new contexts. This study explored health sciences students' preparedness for working, and leading change, in eHealth-enabled environments. Using a cross-sectional study design, 420 undergraduate and postgraduate students participated in an online survey investigating their understanding of and attitude towards eHealth, frequency of online activities and software usage, confidence learning and using ICTs, and perceived learning needs. Although students reported that they regularly engaged with a wide range of online activities and software and were confident learning new ICT skills especially where they have sufficient time or support, their understanding of eHealth was uncertain or limited. Poor understanding of and difficulty translating skills learned in personal contexts to the professional context may impair graduates ability to confidently engage in the eHealth-enabled workplace. These results suggest educators need to scaffold the learning experience to ensure students build on their ICT knowledge to transfer this to their future workplaces.

AB Several Romanian projects target to the train of school teachers with the final goal to professionalize the teaching activity, in-line with the new teaching methodologies and modern technologies. In this respect, the POSDRU Project "ProWeb - A Network for Teachers' Continuous Professional Development in order to Use Multimedia, Virtual Instrumentation and Web 2.0 in the Curricular Area of Mathematics and Natural Sciences" tried to improve the knowledge of the in-service teachers from the area of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, together with primary teachers, on designing and implementing in classrooms of innovative teaching tools, considering multimedia and virtual experiments as main ICT instruments.
   The analysis performed in this paper refers to the various ways of using ICT and modern technologies in the educational process, and their particular applications in classrooms. The analysis is a sociological one and seeks to measure how teachers involved in the curricular area of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, but also those who teach in the Primary School, use multimedia and virtual experiments, and introduce ICT instruments in the teaching process of their specific disciplines. The results of the study are focused on some values that stimulate and encourage further research in this field.

AB The subject of smart cities is highly discussed topic not only in the domain-specific mobility, energy and ICT circles but also in the educational and research-related fields. The questions are arising along with the broader acceptance of smart cities by general public. What are the required crucial competence fields for future smart cities specialists? Are the existing study programs able to cover demand for smart cities education? What are the career prospects for future smart cities specialists? The European Academic Smart Cities Network is aiming to build up competence in the area of smart cities education, to establish an academic network in Austria and to expand the training opportunities at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien with smart cities tailored Bachelor and Master study programs. This paper summarizes the status quo of the project activities and describes exemplary integration of the proposed educational programs based on practice-and professional field-oriented, diversity-fair approach. Starting with the relevant smart cities national strategies, the project proposes cross-departmental integration of smart cities into existing activities. The proposed approach may serve as a base for further development of smart cities specific educational opportunities at university level. Finally, a conclusion of the paper is presented in section 5.

   new technologies
AB Contemporary technologies (ICT) are becoming more and more of an important source of knowledge for governing human resources, especially in the area of the role of education and the acquirement of competences for higher education institution professors. As a long-term goal in the economic and social advancement, there are initiatives regarding the insurance of multiple IT education. Given the fact that Croatia lacks research with the goal of assessing the initial knowledge of IT literacy within higher education institutions, the goal of this research was to pinpoint the level of knowledge and digital competences of professors and associates of the university level in Croatia. The goal was also to determine the frequency of the implementation of contemporary technologies in class and to explain the necessity of implementing the program of Multimedia Training and E-learning at the university level for professors. This research has been done on a representative sample (N = 1800) of professors and associates of universities in Croatia, among different faculties and departments in Osijek, Split, and Zagreb. The results show that the professors and associates of higher education institutions of technical sciences and IT are the most digitally competent ones in scientific research and apply contemporary technologies significantly more (statistically speaking) than the professors and associates dealing with social studies and humanities. The results show that over 70% of professors and associates are deemed to be digitally competent in the usage of computers and new technologies and that over 60% of them regularly use media in class. The examinees are mostly unanimous on the assessment of key digital competences of professors for using new technologies, as well as on the purpose of using new technologies in the teaching process.

AB This paper presents selected findings from an ECAR Study 2014-inspired survey carried out at University of West Bohemia between December 2014 and March 2015. The purpose of the survey was to provide data for updating the curricula and teaching methodology for informatics at the Faculty of Applied Sciences and teacher training at the Faculty of Education. To students in both groups, information and communication technology (ICT) is not just a means of learning but also the subject of studies (informatics and informatics in education). The survey used an electronic questionnaire with selected questions from the ECAR Study 2014. Their wording was identical to the original to ensure that the results were comparable with the data gathered abroad. The questionnaires were completed by a total of 169 students. The survey focused on the ownership of ICT devices among students, particularly various mobile devices (laptop, tablet, e-reader or smartphone), and on the students' use of specific technologies for learning and in the classroom. This paper concentrates on students' attitudes towards in-class use of technologies, and on their assessment of the importance of various technologies for academic success. When compared to ECAR Study 2014 data, our respondents place less emphasis on in-class use of smartphones, tablets and online collaboration tools. Furthermore, they are more sceptical, on the whole, of positive impacts of in-class use of technology on learning results.

AB The adoption of E-Learning activities by higher education institutions, is considered an important contribution for new learning opportunities, both in terms of initial, as well as lifelong training. In the field of clinical education and training, educators and clinicians are gradually recognizing the potential of ICT for learning purposes, practice and assessment of knowledge. In medicine and nursing, there are extensive examples that illustrate the adaptation of technological components and teaching methods. However, as much as it was possible to ascertain, examples are scarce in Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In this paper we propose to explore a case based learning approach for the teaching of therapeutics, using blended learning. When in comparison with face to face setting, our results show a significant better performance in the blended learning group.

AB Like in other sciences, the amount of data available in biology has grown largely. Scientists use bioinformatical approaches to process the data like DNA sequences. The research use of bioinformatics is not reflected in teaching biology at Czech schools. Therefore, a practical course using bioinfomatics was designed and tested. Pre-service teachers who took part in testing also gave their feed-back. The tasks were evaluated as beneficial and bringing new information and skills. The pre-service teachers saw the possible use of the tasks at upper secondary schools as ambivalent.

AB In the past decade the way students interact with the world has changed greatly and social media became the most important channel of communication and information. In this sense the education system is obliged to follow the tendency and use the social networks as a tool to enhance learning, engage students, and extend the learning environment using the platforms. In this objective, the paper presents the opportunities for integration of the social media as an educational tool for raising the efficiency of the instruction of citizenship theory and civil skills. It resumes several aspects of the potential of using social networking for educational purposes in the instruction in the cultural and educational field "Social sciences and civic education". The report presents on one hand the possible usage of the divers tools offered by social media as a channel of teaching civil values and stimulating civil engagement of the young people by structuring their use of study time, pointing to new resources to help them learn and retain knowledge. On the other the report covers the opportunities for integrating social media into the classroom by offering an innovating approach to the presented knowledge and skills in order to help students learn more effectively.

   performance; indicators; engineering education; integrated curriculum
AB A major administrative, government steering and funding reform was implemented in the Finnish Applied Science University system in 2014 and 2015. A major part of 85 % of the new government funding criteria for the Universities of Applied Science is based on individual student reaching 55 of normative 60 ECTS credits. The reform is introduced as background of learning outcome analysis. The change of the funding model also implied many revisions in the education program structures. Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (HMUAS) implemented major revisions in our programs beginning of academic year 2014. Among others, previously separate programmes of Health Technology and Media Engineering were integrated into programme of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as its Major options. The rationale and main lines of the curriculum change, including program merger are described as necessary to expose the research questions. Program performance indicators based on the new funding model are retrospectively calculated against the pre-reform student data over four years to establish stabile programme level performance baseline indicators. The criteria were then applied for cross-comparison purposes, A crosscomparison of the programs is presented based on consistently sampled historical data. In particular, we analyse numerically the results of the first year entry cohorts of 2010-2013 during their studies in the old curriculum compared with the theme-based integrated approach over two first years of 2014-2016. A longitudinal follow-up of the student cohorts who selected the Health Technology and other Majors of an integrated ICT programme in 2015 are be traced back to their original entry cohort of 2014 and initial analysis over the two years of sustained good performance is discussed. The realized and significantly improved indicator values are reported. The performance of the Major groups are analysed over their performance during their second year. A critical assessment discusses especially indicator instability due to many uncontrollable variables, as far as any educational institution is concerned.

AB The massive presence of digital gadgets and tools has changed our lives, mainly as the result of Internet technology. The active role played by the Internet user (prosumers according to Toffler, 1979) has provided a new way to connect with knowledge, characterized by new sources of culture and agents of knowledge, new styles of social participation and interaction, and new forms of contents management and creation (Buckingham, 2005; Pisani y Piotet, 2010; Lopez y Angulo 2015). At a time in which culture is liquid (Bauman, 2006), the educational task becomes more complex and requires a restatement of the educational training and its professional nature. University Degrees on Education have the responsibility to respond to the new ways of teaching and learning which are required by the present digital scenario.
   This paper presents the results of the research carried out in the Faculty of Educational Sciences of the University of Cadiz (UCA) which analyzes digital competences of students in Primary and Infant Education Degrees. The collected data are going to be organized according to the following spheres: timings, spaces and uses of ICTs; the analysis of communicative competences and collaborative learning and information search and management, and the analysis of the level of relevance given by the students to the mastery of ICTs as undergraduates in Educational Sciences and as future teachers. This study involves a reconsideration of the Study plans for Educational Sciences in the Information and Knowledge society.
   The SPSS has been used for the analysis of quantitative data; likewise the categorization research has been used for qualitative or textual data.

AB The Teacher Education Institutions plays a crucial role in improving the system of education by training, educating and inspiring the future student teachers. A teacher requires understanding and mastering of skills to make his classroom interactive. For this purpose the exercise of instructional designing or lesson planning becomes very essential. Although innovative lesson plans based on behaviourist, cognitive and constructivist approaches are introduced in teacher education, the learner today, who is more ICT-enabled requires modern 21st century skills and competencies. The classroom interactive process, used by student-teacher during the professional experience programme, needs a critical analysis and the recent trends in education need to be explored to modify the age old traditional approaches to meet the challenges of the present. This evaluative study explored, developed and ascertained the effectiveness of a hybrid micro-skill called developing and using blends. A number of skills, instructional designs and blended learning literature have been critically analyzed to finalize the components of skills. After conducting primary and secondary data analysis, the effectiveness of the developed skill was checked on high school students selected for this purpose. It was found that in science and social sciences, there is a significant effect of developed micro skill on the academic achievement of high school students, but no significant difference is found in teaching effectiveness of student teachers teaching with and without hybrid micro skill.

AB The objective of the study was to identify, describe and analyze the types, forms of access, use and perception that students and teachers from the degree programme in Sociology of the Catholic University of Temuco have of the Information and Communication Technologies in the teaching- learning process. The main results indicate that ICT have a number of facilities in the teaching learning process from the perspective of the student and the teacher. However, the teachers question ICT as a principal and necessary tool in all areas of education;, on the other hand, the students consider that their use is increasingly necessary in the subjects. It is concluded that the vision of ICT as a key tool in the teaching - learning process is different between teachers and students.

ID PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION
AB Shared expertise, team teaching, and cooperation among lecturers from different fields have become more and more important in promoting learning and achieving more innovative learning outcomes in multidisciplinary universities. To increase and improve sharing expertise between teachers from different faculties and disciplines, we wanted, on one hand, to identify skills and competences that teachers have in common and, on the other hand, to find areas in which they identify that they need complementation. As a framework for this research, we applied Lee Shulman's (1986) seven categories of teachers' knowledge base including the theory of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). The data were collected by group discussions. The teachers (N = 22) represented all seven faculties of Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (UAS), that is, Business School, Civil Engineering and Building Services, Culture and Creative Industries, Health Care and Nursing, School of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Industrial Engineering, and Welfare and Human Functioning. The data were analyzed using theory-based content analysis. According to our data, the mutual core competence of a teacher is the capacity to interact effectively. It is a basis for shared expertise. Interaction skills are necessary in collaborative construction of knowledge as students, teachers of different fields, and their partners inside and outside the organization co-operate. Multidisciplinary co-operation among colleagues also helps to maintain subject matter knowledge, as it supports peer learning and encourages everyone to move out of their comfort zones.

AB Augmented Reality is considered one of the emerging technologies with the highest impact on teaching. The current paper shows a research about an educative experience carried out in university students, future teachers, in the field of social sciences, in order to know their opinion about Augmented Reality and its educational application. This study, which followed a mixed approach (quantitative and qualitative), was conducted among students in the Master Degree at the Faculty of Education in Albacete (University of Castilla-La Mancha) in the first term of academic year 2014/2015. LabinTic_RA Questionnaire (Cozar, De Moya, Hernandez and Hernandez, 2014) was administered to analyse students' perceptions about Augmented Reality. Thus, students' use in the teaching and learning process and their knowledge of this tool were taking into account for our research. Results revealed that students give a highly positive assessment to ICT and Augmented Reality for its educative benefits: motivation, interactive learning or significant acquisition of knowledge, among others. The virtualization of education is a reality, so it is necessary the teacher training in order to know and to use emerging educational technologies.

AB Background: Virtual teams collaborate across distances using information communication technologies (ICTs). A distinctive set of communication skills is needed by people who work successfully in virtual teams, and few universities or companies provide structured education and training in virtual teamwork. At a midsized southeastern Masters Comprehensive University, professors from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education came together to explore how they might use cross-disciplinary student teams (groups comprised of students with different backgrounds and educational goals) to teach concepts in their own disciplines while providing students with the opportunity to become more proficient in virtual team communication. Research questions: (1) Can cross-disciplinary student team projects successfully support learning in virtual team communication as well as address the learning objectives of specific courses? (2) What can faculty learn from a cross-disciplinary teaching model that can be applied to virtual teams? Situating the case: Experiential learning is based on performing real tasks and reflecting on that process; it benefits learners by engaging them in complex, authentic situations. Virtual teams are significant because they support a great deal of the work currently taking place in our global economy; they are significant in higher education because students need to develop skills in international virtual communication before they are introduced to high-stakes work environments. In previous cases, students have collaborated across national cultures to develop project deliverables, such as websites, reports, and usability studies and present them in virtual environments using such tools as WebEx, Skype, and live streaming. How this case was studied: The findings from this case are based on individual student reflections, which were used to create a data matrix for each project, and instructor observation and evaluation. About the case: In Spring 2013, six faculty from the same university worked together to incorporate virtual teams into their classrooms. These six faculty members were divided into two groups of three with each group representing three colleges mentioned earlier. The faculty developed two interdisciplinary projects (one on infographics and another on social media) that enabled rich and diverse student collaboration. In both groups, the three faculty leaders worked together to define a project scope that students could achieve and that would relate to learning goals in each discipline. Conclusions: The lessons learned from this experience are that: (1) technical challenges will occur; (2) students from all disciplines must receive the same information; (3) instructors must balance respect for their colleagues and support for their students; (4) team assignments need to be consistent and fair; (5) instructors need to establish appropriate and fair assessment measurements for their own students; and (6) projects need to be realistic in order to show the students the value of virtual work.

AB The long-running higher education network AQUA-TNET, a tightly-knit collaboration of university departments, research institutes and other stakeholders from the aquaculture industry, was established in 1996 by AQUATT, a coordinating partner in the SOCRATES-ERASMUS Thematic Network DEMETER led by ICA (Association for European Life Sciences Universities). Later, AQUA-TNET activities continued under an umbrella organisation, the AFANET Thematic Network. Previous work on accreditation in European aquaculture courses carried out by AQUA-TNET's first coordinator, the UETP (University Enterprise Training Partnership) AQUATT enabled the fledging network of 15 partners to publish details of aquaculture courses in all its 15 member countries and to focus on issues soon to be raised as part of the emergent Bologna Process (1999). AQUA-TNET's ground-breaking work in educational reforms led to its steady expansion, with the result that in 2005 it was established as a stand-alone ERASMUS Thematic Network. Its achievements from 2005 to 2011 under the coordination of Gent University (Belgium) and from 2011 to 2014 of the University of Stirling (UK), demonstrate the incremental impact of AQUA-TNET's long-term activities. AQUA-TNET played a leading co-operative role between higher education institutions, further education providers, research institutions and industry, defining and developing a high-quality European dimension within its academic disciplines. Activities included contributions to Bologna priorities such as student and staff mobility (M.Sc. and Ph.D. online portals detailing all members' courses); development of innovative M.Sc., Ph.D., HE/VET and Lifelong Learning (LLL) programmes; organisation of hands-on workshops on new technologies (e-learning, ICT); identification of flexible pathways for lifelong learners (EQF and ECVET); developing diversified language learning for HE; excellent online forum (www.aquatnet.com) disseminating comprehensive information to all stakeholders, including industry.

ID POWERPOINT
AB The study aimed to capture a snapshot of the status of educational means used in teaching and learning in the area of aquaculture, fisheries and aquatic resources management at European level, with specific consideration on the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and e-learning tools. To achieve this goal, an online survey was compiled and made available to teachers and students across Europe. In total, teachers from 31 institutions and students from 40 institutions participated in this survey. This paper presents the findings, considers trends and poses further questions for sector stakeholders to help in the development of future programmes and support. In summary, it can be concluded that few teachers have a comprehensive knowledge of the wide range of ICT tools available and can make use of e-learning tools with complete confidence. There is therefore a real and urgent need to "train the trainers" to use ICT in their teaching environments. From the students' end, there is a strong desire to learn more about the application of e-learning tools and to use them in their learning process.

TI STRATEGIES FOR THE USE OF A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN SECOND LANGUAGE

DT Article
DE Virtual Learning Environment; English; teaching-learning process; ICT
AB The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has highlighted since 1948 the importance of learning a second language because of its professional, social, cultural, academic, and even personal potentials. Understanding that it moves towards a technological society, the processes of teaching and learning break the traditional schemes and incorporate new virtual learning environments that allow the implementation of technologies. By learning a foreign language, it tends to "pass" in somehow the knowledge about the structures and features of the mother tongue into the foreign language. This influence of the mother tongue on the foreign language is called "transfer" which often impedes production in the second language. The purpose of this research is to create a virtual learning environment in the English modules using Moodle for 114 UNEMI students of Health and Engineering Sciences, who are considered part of the generation "Y" through a single, factual and intrinsic case study, with a descriptive, heuristic and inductive level. The results of this research determined that the use of ICT tools when learning a second language presents greater opportunities for the teacher and students because they both can be separated with respect to the synchrony and this is not an obstacle, so learning is conducted with success; this support tool helps the acquired knowledge to become perfect with practice.

AB Innovation in information and communication technologies (ICTs) is providing us with a myriad of travel information sources. Knowledge on the influence of information on human travel behaviour (mainly route and mode choice) and their implications on network levels of service remains fragmented. We distinguish between experiential, descriptive, and prescriptive information sources. We draw on recently developed theoretical concepts in behavioural and cognitive sciences to examine the state of the knowledge on information and travel behaviour. Key theoretical concepts used to explore the relationship between information and travel behaviour include: reinforced learning; framing; risk and loss aversion; probability weighting; affect; anchoring and ambiguity aversion; and regret aversion. We review studies focusing on individual travel behaviour as well as network studies involving collective behaviours. While information seems to assist individual travellers in coping with uncertainty, the impacts relating to collective behaviour on networks remain unclear. Many open questions remain, yet research provides important insights and suggests that ICTs will enable the design of persuasive information systems that motivate cooperative and efficient use of the transportation network beyond what is possible today.

AB Computer science (CS) and its enabling technologies are at the heart of this information age, yet its adoption as a core subject by senior secondary students in Indian schools is low and has not reached critical mass. Though there have been efforts to create core curriculum standards for subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Math, CS seems to have been kept outside the purview of such efforts leading to its marginalization. As a first step, using the Darmstadt model from the ITiCSE working group that provides a systematic categorization approach to CS education in schools, we coded and analyzed the CS situation for the Indian schools. Next, we focused on the motivation category of the Darmstadt model and investigated behavioral intentions of secondary school students and teachers from 332 schools in India. Considering the CS subject as an educational innovation, using Rogers' Theory of Diffusion of Innovations, we propose a pedagogical framework for innovation attributes that can significantly predict-adoption of the CS subject among potential-adopter students and teachers. Data was analyzed to answer research questions about student and teacher intentions, influence of gender, school management, and school location in adopting CS. Interestingly, girls, urban students, teachers, and private schools were seen favoring the adoption of CS. An important issue that needed to be addressed, however, was the interchangeable use of terms like CS, Informatics, ICT, and digital literacy. Through our article, we offer a promising picture of the educational policy directives and the academic environment in India that is rapidly growing and embracing CS as a core subject of study in schools. We also analyze the factors that influence the adoption of CS by school students and teachers and conclude that there is a very positive response for CS among educators and students in India.

AB Virtual labs are popularized as a visual education tool that offers diverse analysis of experiments through different components like graphics mediated animations, mathematically modeled simulations, user interactive emulations, remote-triggered experiments and the use of augmented perception haptic devices. With the advances in ICT-based education, virtual labs have become a novel platform that helps users to engage in their proactive learning process. Our goal was to analyze the effective role of biotechnology virtual labs in improving academic performance of students and complementing classroom education. We tested the adaptability, perceived usefulness and ease of use of biotechnology virtual labs on different user groups in sciences and engineering. This study focuses mainly on the student and teacher groups from different universities across India. Feedback data was collected via a direct approach using organized workshops conducted in the year 2014-2015. 85% of participants suggested perceived usefulness of biotechnology virtual labs helped them to improve their academic performance compared to a traditional classroom scenario. Most users indicated the learning materials provided by virtual lab system were easy to understand, thus suggesting the better adaptability of ICT-enabled techniques amongst different users. This augments the role of virtual labs for remote learners all over the world. For India, such learning methods have helped overcome limitations seen in classroom-based education such as equipment accessibility, location and other economic issues. Through these studies, we construe the usage of virtual labs as a next-gen interactive textbook and as a media-rich learning source of distance and blended education.

AB Over the last decade the technology of education has gained an important place in the educational process. To enhance this reality, international organizations have stated the need to use information technology and digital technology in the process of teaching, learning, assessment and evaluation. The most important international organizations which make recommendations and elaborate guidelines are UNESCO and European Commission. Considering these recommendations to use digital technology in education corroborated with the need of students to use it in their educational process, to collaborate, to work in teams, to contribute to their learning, the Faculty of Psychology and Sciences of Education of University of Bucharest within master programme ICT in Education and the Distance Learning department of University of Bucharest within its master programmes have courses designed mostly to enhance the use of digital technology in educational process. Therefore, the aim of the present research is to present a case of good practices in which the constructivist approach of learning is supported by technology using Google Apps like Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Slides. The case study is focused on the idea that learning is possible through dual factors: social interaction and simultaneous exposure to cognitive experiences in which peer and collaborative learning is central and the teacher is also mediator, moderator and facilitator of learning supporting students to develop digital competencies, positive attitudes of self-esteem and empathy and cognitive abilities. The overarching outcome will be a coherent image of a master course designed to enhance ideas with technology based on a constructivist approach.

AB This paper describes an innovative e-Learning project proposal, named MeToo, aiming to enhance existing e-learning platforms by developing tools and services which support the detection and representation of learners' emotions, as well as emotion-based learning adaptation and affective feedback. To this end, MeToo applies novel emotion detection models to rich multimodal data collected using state of the art channels, advanced sensors and novel adaptive interfaces. Via multiple small-scale pilots in formal, informal and workplace learning environments, MeToo system will intend to demonstrate a positive impact of emotion-aware e-learning on decreasing learners drop-out rates, increasing satisfaction and improving learning performance, thus making learning as a whole a better experience. MeToo's approach requires a multi discipline perspective with expertise in e-learning, software development, internet of things, educational psychology, affective sciences, social sciences and neuroscience. To this end, MeToo not only includes experts in the above domains but also specialists with access to primary and secondary schools, university students, corporate learners and open education users. The paper shows the most relevant aspects of the scientific approaches of this project proposal submitted to the Horizon 2020 ICT program of the European Commission.

AB This chapter provides a reflection on the alignment between the ideal of campus greening and realities while moving towards greater sustainability in open and distance learning (ODL) in a developing world (Global South) context. The case study presented involves the University of South Africa (Unisa), a leading ODL provider and the largest university on the African continent. The focus is on the junior postgraduate (honours level/fourth year) offerings of the School of Environmental Sciences (SES), with greening implications and challenges associated with the shift from correspondence to online provisioning. Until recently, Unisa was a "traditional" distance education institution with heavy reliance on print-based material. The transformation from print-based to online offerings had a slow start because of issues related to access within the developing world context. These issues have to be addressed because of the direct greening implications of going online in the higher education sector. This reflection on the move from correspondence to online provisioning will be conducted against the backdrop of the transformation Unisa went through over the last decade, and which was triggered by the merger of the three former distance education institutions in South Africa into one mega institution. Developments such as a huge increase in student numbers, implementation of ODL as business model and becoming a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), had various impacts on Unisa. Within the latter context, a reflexive account is provided of the greening implications, challenges and solutions associated with the facilitation of online learning experiences and specifically online learning design, assessment and student support. Successful implementation and positive spinoffs for campus greening, however, will depend on buy-in from students, staff and college faculty. In order to achieve success, the attitudes and perceptions of these stakeholders need to be considered. By way of conclusion, some preliminary findings in this regard for the SES (Unisa) are made, thus contributing to the limited body of knowledge about the infusion of information and communication technologies in ODL provisioning in developing world (Global South) contexts.

DE ICT; accounting sciences; teaching; learning
AB The teaching of accounting sciences requires innovative alternative methodologies that allow a greater dynamism in students' learning processes, encouraging their autonomy in order to foster greater understanding and ownership of accounting topics covered in class. In that sense, the use of ICT for educational purposes has been positioned as a dynamic and interactive alternative that allows the application of knowledge and encourages the feedback in the learning process.
   This paper aims to reflect on the use of ICT in accounting education as a strategy to improve teaching and learning processes in students of the Department of Finance of Metropolitan Institute of Technology of Medellin. It is proposed a teaching method with a learning virtual object through a virtual mediator of accounting formulations. It has a pedagogical purpose of providing students with a conceptual and practical tool to interpret and analyze accounting and financial topics at the enterprise level.
   It is observed that the interaction between accounting graph logic and logic of dynamic perception facilitates the processes of teaching and learning in the disciplines of accounting and finance. It is reflected in greater motivation and understanding of mathematical equations in financial area that will carry out to experimentation of knowledge learned in the classroom. (C) 2015 The Authors.

DE ITC; traditional; school; learning; prior knowledge
AB This research project "ICT as an interdisciplinary tool (TICHIN). Pilot study" aims to test the effectiveness of basic general knowledge acquisition through multimedia resources as a learning tool, as opposed to a more traditional methodology, in Primary Education. It is a prospective study (planned) which has made use of an experimental method with pretest and posttest and different techniques and tools for data collection.
   This research was conducted in various schools in Castellon with students of 1, 3 and 5 Year of Primary Education, being three of these schools private and one state school. Different contents related to natural sciences were taught, namely, living beings, matter and energy, technology, objects and machines, among others. All classes partaking in this study were divided into two randomized groups, one group being taught through the more traditional method (control group), and the other through multimedia resources (experimental group). Upon completion of the sessions, all students filled in a questionnaire, which allowed for the analysis of the results based on variables such as: the initial knowledge of the participants in each group, the knowledge acquired through both methodologies employed, and group of students whose knowledge was greater after the posttest.
   The results indicate that, as opposed to the control group, the students in 3 Year who were taught through the use of ICT obtained a higher degree of knowledge. On the other hand, both in 1 and 5 Year Primary Education, students who were taught through ICT obtained better results in the posttest, with the exception of two of the eight classes participating, in which the knowledge acquired was more limited in both groups.
   Last but not least, it is imperative to mention that a group of teachers taught the same contents in two different schools, and during both interventions there was a number of students who did show any progress in their learning. It might follow that the teacher might have an influence on the learning process of the students, regardless of whether the content is taught through a more traditional methodology or ICT.

AB Among others, the report named Perspectivas 2015 carried out by Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona and Aulaplaneta indicated that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will be included in teaching learning process. This study analyzes the perspective about the XXI century Spanish classrooms in relation to the implementation of some technological devices, digital services and educational methodologies, and it also indicates that 70% of teachers believes that in a short term (2017-2018) will be used, prominently, technological tools (whiteboards, wireless networks, etc.) and educational digital services (blogs, wikis, digital environments, etc.). However, this future implementation of ICT in the classroom is here a paradox because, currently, there is no a specific subject on technologies in the initial teacher training of the Degree of Early Childhood Education in any of the four campuses of the Universidad de Castilla La-Mancha (Spain) in spite of involving competences considered in the verification report of that grade. This fact has contributed to the implementation of research-action process in order to know the acceptance of certain digital tools (Symbaloo, Padlet and Thinglink) as learning resources to support the teaching. It has been developed in the subject of Social and Culture Didactics for students in the Third Grade of the Degree of Early Childhood Education. This methodology, encouraged by technologies, has allowed arousing students' curiosity promoting an efficient use of ICT and skill development to improve the acquisition of digital competences because learning materials with applications in the university environment of Moodle platform (forums, activities, etc.) were combined. After the experience, the results obtained by the SWOT analysis, carried out by the students, have shown a positive evaluation in relation to the use of these digital applications for the Degree of Early Childhood Education. Finally, it has been concluded that the use of New Technologies applied to Education becomes vital to contribute to the essential trinomial education-technology and development.

AB Mexico has more than 125 million inhabitants, making it the 11th most populated country in the world, with 81.72 million people between 14 and 65 years of age, who are potentially active in the generation of Mexican wealth. The Educational System has the challenge of generating 1.4 million well prepare professionals each year. Furthermore the effort must reach all and every corner of the country.
   This work propose a Cooperation-Competitive (Coopetitive) approach that allows coordinated work among the Secretary of Public Education (SEP), the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ) and government funds from National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) or some other international organizations. To work on an overall knowledge transfer strategy with e-learning over the Cloud, where experts in junior high and high school education, working in multidisciplinary teams perform analysis, evaluation, design, production, validation and knowledge transfer at large scale using a Cloud Computing platform. Allowing teachers and students to have all the information required to ensure a homologated nationally knowledge of topics such as mathematics, statistics, chemistry, history, ethics, civism, etc. This work will start with a pilot test in Spanish and initially in two regional dialects Otomi and Nahuatl. Otomi has more than 285,000 speaking indigenes in Queretaro and Mexico's central region. Nahuatl is number one indigenous dialect spoken in Mexico with more than 1,550,000 indigenes [1].
   The phase one of the project takes into account negotiations with indigenous tribes from different regions, and the Information and Communication technologies to deliver the knowledge to the indigenous schools in their native dialect.

DE Teaching; Technology; Law
AB The information and communications technology (ICT) have become one of the main tools used for teaching, especially for the upper level; however studies have shown that these are not applied in the same way in all educational programs, this is due, perhaps, by the different career profiles, or it is possible that the lack of training in the educational use of technologies or unwillingness on the part of teachers to use them. In this regard it is important to note that as they move ICT, higher education institutions have been forced to make changes that can incorporate in their educational planning, because if it is true that many universities have been concerned about technology, It is also a reality that still continues disregarding the pedagogical part that may lead to a good educational use of them. In addition to this, lawyer's career has been one of the areas of Social Sciences has been doing fundamental changes in their teaching, because for years it has been thought that lawyers should learn only traditional lectures, however in recent years it has tried to supplement those classes with ICT, but so far there are not many studies showing how it has conducted this process; so that is founded on these precepts is intended investigate how teachers Lawyer Career of Centro Universitario de los Altos of the University of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, are using technology in their work and all know if they nurture the learning of future lawyers. For this purpose it is intended to develop a joint research under sequential design, which shows a consistent quantitative analysis qualitative development, and thus interpret and deepen the results. The aim is to design an instrument that will be validated and tested for reliability based on the results obtained semi-structured interviews that help to complement the information obtained in the quantitative part are designed. The results provide a basis for planning a proposal in which the teachers of the law career using ICT in teaching.

DE service design; innovation process; digital service; higher education
AB In order to respond to the challenges posed by digitalisation, new competence and operating models are required in working life. This, on the other hand, requires developing the content and methods of higher education. This paper describes an experiment that addresses developing higher education in service design studies at Laurea University of Applied Sciences.
   The pedagogical starting point for the development work was a pedagogical model, Learning by Developing (LbD), that is based on learning through research and developing (R&D). Expertise and experiences are shared between teachers and students as well as other project partners. While working in the project teams, students take part as equal partners bringing their expertise with them. The teacher members of the project team take part by providing their expertise to steer the progress of the work and, at the same time, the progress of learning.
   The objectives of the development work were: (1) to gain a research-oriented, developmental and problem-based higher education approach to studying; (2) to produce new methods and techniques to involve multidisciplinary students, citizens, companies, and the public and third sectors in the development of digital services; (3) to provide students with competence to use diverse development methods and tools flexible at all stages of the service design process; and (4) to provide students with competence to gather, structure and apply information in genuine R&D contexts. The development work focused not only on the pedagogical issues, but also on student and stakeholder participation in the innovation process, and on applying and developing appropriate service design tools and techniques for that purpose.
   The development work was conducted during the multidisciplinary master's degree service design studies in the project called WeLive. The WeLive project was devised to transform the current e-Government approach by facilitating a more open model of design, production and delivery of public services leveraging on the collaboration between public sector, citizens and entrepreneurs. WeLive applies the service design approach to deliver next generation personalised digital services to citizens. For that, it contributes with the WeLive platform, an ICT infrastructure where stakeholders collaborate in the ideation, creation, funding and deployment of new digital services.
   The outcomes of the development work were (1) a new teaching model in line with the service design process, with the aim of providing students with the ability to act as service designers and innovation processes developers, and (2) an open innovation process model to involve multidisciplinary students, citizens, companies, and the public and third sectors in the development of digital services.

DE ICT; clinical assessment; dental education; Periodontology
AB Teaching in health sciences should be combine scientific evidence with accumulated clinical experience. Currently, this teaching is supplemented with a student-centered learning, in which the student becomes responsible for their own learning, and where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) represents a learning aid in order to present, process and integrate information.
   Objective: To examine if the use of ICT helps students in improving their basic skills in training in Dentistry, specifically in periodontal diagnosis.
   Specific objective: To compare a test (supported by an ICT tool) and a control groups, in terms of the performance in periodontal diagnosis.
   Method: Firstly, diagnostic virtual guides were constructed using the material resulting from the application of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in the subject of Periodontology. Subsequently, an experimental study was designed with students of the subject of Periodontology (2nd year course), who were randomized into a test (n=26) and a control group (n=36). The test group received reinforcement in their learning by accessing these virtual guides. Both groups were examined at the beginning and at the end of the course. T test was used to compare marks between the test and control groups.
   Result: The marks of the students of the test group improved significantly their performance in diagnosis (initial marks 5.64 +/- 2.36 vs final marks 7.42 +/- 1.67), when compared to the changes the control group (initial marks 5.83 +/- 2.23 vs final marks 5.69 +/- 2.21) (p=0.0003). The number of students, who obtained the minimum mark to pass the exam, was significantly higher (81.8%), when compared to those of the control group (37.9%) (p=0.003).
   Conclusion: The use of virtual guides improves the performance of students in periodontology diagnosis, in the teaching of Periodontology.

AB The foreign language teachers working in a university of applied life sciences benefit from a permanent exchange with the teachers of scientific disciplines. This partnership can improve its results by developing strategies for integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) into students' training. Our paper aims at presenting the progress and at analysing the results of a transdisciplinary activity that brought together foreign language teachers and specialized disciplines teachers who designed on-line learning contents for their students. The purposes of this experience were to prepare better skilled teachers by making changes in their educational environment. The training implied individual research, resource sharing between teachers and on-line collaboration for creating learning materials using ICTs. The module, focused on the biochemical compounds in human food, was designed using tools like Moodle resources, Hot Potatoes, Netvibes and Delicious and became part of a course for students in food processing industry. The effective use of technology as a pedagogical tool into Content Based Instruction (CBI) classroom allowed teachers to achieve greater educational outcomes by contributing to improve students' language proficiency while they were also engaged in subject matter learning.

AB Mexico has more than 125 million inhabitants, making it the 11th most populated country in the world, with 81.72 million people between 14 and 65 years of age, who are potentially active in the generation of Mexican wealth. The Educational System has the challenge of generating 1.4 million well prepare professionals each year. Furthermore the effort must reach all and every corner of the country.
   This work propose a Cooperation-Competitive (Coopetitive) approach that allows coordinated work among the Secretary of Public Education (SEP), the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ) and government funds from National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) or some other international organizations. To work on an overall knowledge transfer strategy with e-learning over the Cloud, where experts in junior high and high school education, working in multidisciplinary teams perform analysis, evaluation, design, production, validation and knowledge transfer at large scale using a Cloud Computing platform. Allowing teachers and students to have all the information required to ensure a homologated nationally knowledge of topics such as mathematics, statistics, chemistry, history, ethics, civism, etc. This work will start with a pilot test in Spanish and initially in two regional dialects Otomi and Nahuatl. Otomi has more than 285,000 speaking indigenes in Queretaro and Mexico's central region. Nahuatl is number one indigenous dialect spoken in Mexico with more than 1,550,000 indigenes.
   The phase one of the project takes into account negotiations with indigenous tribes from different regions, and the Information and Communication technologies to deliver the knowledge to the indigenous schools in their native dialect.
   The methodology include the following main milestones: identification of the indigenous areas where Otomi and Nahuatl are the spoken dialects, research with the SEP the location of actual indigenous schools, analysis and inventory or current schools conditions, negotiation with tribe chiefs, analysis of the technological communication requirements to reach the indigenous communities, identification and inventory of local teachers technology knowledge, selection of a pilot topic, analysis of actual student competence with traditional education system, identification of local translators, design of the e-learning platform, design of the multimedia resources and storage strategy for "Cloud Computing", translation of the topic to both dialects, Indigenous teachers training, pilot test, course release, project follow up, analysis of student requirements for the new technological platform, definition of a new and improved proposal with greater reach in topics and regions.
   Importance of phase one of the project is multiple, it includes the proposal of a working technological scheme, focusing in the cultural impact in Mexico so that indigenous tribes can improve their knowledge about new forms of crop improvement, home storage technologies, proven home remedies for common diseases, ways of preparing foods containing major nutrients, disclose strengths and weaknesses of each region, communicating through cloud computing platforms offering regional products and opening communication spaces for inter-indigenous cultural exchange.

AB Beyond any doubt, "learning" and "learning processes" are considered of basic issues in behavioral sciences, psychology, education and educational management. The process was born with human being and has evolved during human being development. The evolutionary procedure has continued its life in learning studies and researches. The current paper aims at investigating the evolutionary trend of learning theories employing descriptive method and studying hard and soft resources. In the present study, learning in real and virtual spaces has been analyzed. Although the emergence of new technologies, generally in education field and especially in learning field, has changed the quantity and quality of those fields, it has created concerns over learners' national values, social development and affective development. Therefore, blended learning has introduced as the strategy for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) era and a model has proposed. Employing educational social networks, electronic learning (e-learning) and networked management plus exploiting social interactions among learners and teachers, teachers and parents and other reciprocal interactions, blended learning can solve numerous concerns of parents and educational specialists while optimizing learning process.

AB The development of the society of the communication and the knowledge suppose the creation of new tools and the incorporation of those tools at the world of the education. This implies new possibilities in the process of teaching-learning. The purpose of this work is to present quantitative results about the level of knowledge and use of social networks and web services by undergraduate students in the University of Granada. It has been also examined how university teachers integrate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into classroom practice. Data was collected by means of a questionnaire administered to third course students of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering degrees during the year 2014-2015.
   The results showed that Facebook and Twitter are the most frequently used social network by students in the mentioned degrees. These are followed by other social networks and web applications like messenger. On the other hand, virtual learning environments commonly used in the teaching-learning process by the students and university teachers are SWAD and Moodle, among others. Besides, it is important to highlight that Power Point is the most employed tool for presentations by means of students. Other tools like Prezi are use in a much less extension with this purpose. Finally, we can state that the use of ICT is continuously increasing the teaching-learning processes.

AB The learning based on the practice or on the experience ("learning by doing"), it is considered to be an active learning that allows to the students to discover and to confirm knowledge by themselves, across their own experience. This way, the educational research featured is part of a strategy of educational innovation developed by several professors of the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II from the University of Granada. With this educational action we try to construct a solid knowledge, not based exclusively on what it has been explained to the students, but in what they have experienced. In this sense, the student can manage to understand the studied matter, promoting a long-term, solid learning. Having this outcome as principal aim, some practical classes were developed out of the classroom, to study the cardiovascular system using innovative and explanatory technologies and the different multimedia resources of the exhibition "Trip to the human body. The heart" of the Sciences Park of Granada. The students who voluntarily enrolled in this educational strategy, answered a series of questions related to the matter being studied and with their own learning process, before and after the visit to the multimedia exhibition, allowing to study and to compare the degree of assimilation of the studied knowledge and the possible improvement for the education-learning process that has offered the visit to the exhibition. The evaluation of these questions allowed us to confirm that the acquisition of knowledge based on the own experience and the development of collaborative activities is much better in comparison with the traditional method of education in the classroom. In addition, this strategy has promoted the scientific curiosity and the collaboration between the students.

DE multidisciplinary; use of tics; information management; innovation
AB The ability to find information and how to process it is one of the main challenges of education in the information society where vast amounts of information are easily available. Process information implies testing its reliability, reaching a diagnosis about its accuracy and/or combining information if it comes from different sources or has peculiarities that require verification. Collaboration between diverse cultural institutions such as archives, museums and libraries is substantially important and future teachers of primary and secondary schools should teach how to acquire these skills. In the Teacher Training College BAM (Bilbao) it is offered a subject shared by the BAM, the Archive and the Museum named "Laboratory of active methods for interdisciplinary learning sciences" which is included in the Curriculum of Primary Education pathway in curricular deepening (6ECTS). During the course of this subject, students take part in various workshops where they create scientific-didactic materials for social and natural sciences where the use of ICT's is fundamental. Students work in projects and use ICT-s with the aim of making real the comprehensive rethinking of teaching and learning that is needed which highlights innovation and multidisciplinary.
   Our aim in this paper is to present this college subject as a commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration between the Archive, the Museum and the University. The projects seeks to generate knowledge networks and break with the isolated strategies and dynamics that institutions sometimes tend to deploy. Not only three institutions are taking part in this project but also five professionals of different disciplines. Both the planning and the implementation, are clear and innovative commitments to the interdisciplinarity. Owe to this, materials and projects are developed from different points of view and diverse professional perspectives (arts, psychology, didactics, philosophy, history, files, the use of tics and so on).
   The educational project that takes shape in the course "Laboratory of active methods for interdisciplinary learning science" emerges in the context of creating the European Higher Education Area, more popularly known as "Bologna Process". In Spain, the implementation of Bachelor's degrees has been a substantial part of this process. Bachelor degrees have replaced traditional degrees and diplomas, based on ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) credits. This situation involved a redesign of the curriculum in different majors, which allowed the introduction of new subjects such as the present one. This laboratory is part of the Bachelor of Primary Education pathway in Curricular deepening. The course is taught in Begoako Andra Mari Teacher Training University College, attached to the University of Deusto (Bilbao) since the course year 2011-2012.

DE ICT-based education; Rural entrepreneurship; Farmers; Socio-economic
   development
AB By employing modern agriculture and information and communication technologies, many of world farmers are becoming now successful entrepreneurs to create wealth and job opportunities elsewhere. Business environment nowadays changes rapidly. Agriculture and rural sector is not an exception. For the entrepreneur farmers, the change in business environment is rather an opportunity to create wealth. Many Sri Lankan young farmers can be rich by employing rural entrepreneur skills. University of Colombo Institute for Agro-technology and Rural Sciences (UCIARS) has designed and implemented the island-wide ICT based agro-technology diploma courses leading to a degree in order to expand the power of technology to more people and areas in rural Sri Lanka. In general, farm productivity of the 350 student farmers has been remarkably improved due to this innovative way of e-learning.
   Although many of the student farmers already started their own agro industry and enterprises, there is a lack of funding for improving their agri-businesses to achieve their targets. Therefore the institute actively engaged in this case to assist them financially and giving them relevant guidance, information, technology and knowledge. UCIARS offered its financial assistance to selected talented student farmers to commence new agribusinesses or upgrade their existing agri-businesses in loan basis with very low interest rate after receiving the project proposals from interested students. The beneficiaries were evaluated based on their fieldwork performances, marketing performances and record keeping activities based on the information obtain through field visits. Further, they were evaluated based on the performances shown in frequent interactions with Institute and timely payment of installments. Socioeconomic impact of the selected student farmers were evaluated under the criteria of improvements of productivity, income, knowledge, skill, communication ability and social contacts. It has shown that all above criteria were significantly improved due to ICT based education and rural entrepreneurship development.

AB In this paper we present a model of software defined network infrastructure for an e-learning cloud. The goal of the model was to design a reliable, resilient and scalable infrastructure, that was capable to support dynamic flexibility required for emerging types of applications, advanced e-learning applications and services, as well as to foster increasing speed of data flow. Specifically, the infrastructure should support the education in the fields of modern information and communication technologies, such as cloud computing, enterprise networking, mobile computing, and big data. The Software defined networks (SDN) infrastructure was based on Open Stack cloud management system. Networking as a service was implemented through integration of Neutron, Open Daylight and Open vSwitch solutions. This concept allows intensive collaboration and exchanging data and information with other universities and industry. The evaluation was conducted within the course Cloud infrastructure and services, at Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, where students learnt to design and deploy software defined networking infrastructure for an enterprise. The results showed that the designed infrastructure can effectively support the learning process. In addition, performance of the e-learning infrastructure was analyzed and discussed.

DE Training; professors; ICT; teaching learning process
AB Information and communications technology (ICT) have sharply stormed in most of the branches of social, economic and political life of the world that is the reason for which it is considered a necessity that, under current conditions of constant changes, where education is not free from this influence, professors upgrade their knowledge, not only to manage these technologies, but also to use them with didactic fundamentals. There are learning needs in professors with respect to the use of technology in classrooms and laboratories to develop teaching with the quality required by the Model of Professional of the Engineer in Informatics Sciences. This work aims at presenting training in ICT as a means of teaching-learning process for teachers in the University of Informatics Sciences. This proposal is a partial result of the project: (CALINFOR). Quality of the formation of the engineers with sustenance in the bond university - industry (of the software) and the ICT, developed by a group of investigation of the Center of Innovation of the Educational Quality (CICE).

DE ICT in elementary schools; students', parents' and teachers' attitudes
   toward ICT in learning and teaching
AB The pilot-project "Psychological aspects of use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in elementary education" is conducted by a research group from the Department of Psychology, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Rijeka, Croatia. The main goal was to examine positive and negative aspects of ICT use in two elementary schools that have different levels of ICT integration in the teaching and learning environment. The intention is to continue the systematic tracking of the long-term effects of ICT use on students' academic achievement, as well as on ICT attitudes of the students, their parents' and teachers', and students' motivation.
   The project has several phases:
   (1) In the focus groups, teachers (N=37) discussed advantages and disadvantages of ICT use in teaching and learning.
   (2) The results of the focus group discussions were used to design questionnaires for students, parents, and teachers, assessing the frequency and reasons for use of ICT and attitudes toward ICT. Several scales for assessing different aspects of academic motivation were also adapted (perceived value of school, goal orientation, and self-efficacy).
   (3) The questionnaires were administered in two schools. While in both schools computers are available to teachers, in one school iPads are used in the classrooms (teachers are trained to teach with iPads and 55% of students have their own iPad and use it for every school subject). A total number of 354 students (5th to 8th grade, aged between 10-14; 51% boys), 304 parents (mean age=41,72; 81% female) and 40 teachers (mean age=46; 77,5% female) from both schools participated in the study. Validity and reliability analyses of all used instruments show good psychometric properties.
   Some preliminary results show that most of the students, parents and teachers use different kinds of ICT equipment (computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phones). Students in the school in which iPads are implemented in classrooms, and who use iPads, have more positive attitues toward ICT and the use of tablet computers in education, compared to those students that do not use iPads. However, when comparing the two schools, students in the school in which iPads are not implemented have a more positive attitude toward the use of tablet computers in education, while teachers have more negative attitudes. There is no difference in parental attitudes toward tablet use in education between those two schools.
   (4) A follow-up study is going to be conducted at the end of the school year. In addition to previously applied questionnaires, academic achievement will be recorded.
   This pilot-project serves as a preliminary study for the wider research project that is going to explore integration of ICT in education in a number of schools with different levels of digital maturity in Croatia.

DE e-self-assessment; e-Learning; Innovation project; Improving Teaching
   Quality; Moodle; blended-learning
AB The New Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as Moodle platform virtual campus (CV) allow students a blended-learning system by promoting the development of skills of self-education, self-governance and responsibility skills. Moodle is a very versatile tool and among its options allows to incorporate a system of e-Self-assessment favoring a formative feedback and promoting active participation of students, which is certainly good for their training. The e-self-assessment is considered as an e-Learning strategy (Carless, 2006; Nicol, 2007; Rodriguez et al, 2011).
   During the year 2013-14, with the support of an Innovation Project and Improvement of Teaching Quality Educational of the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), we decided to use the e-Self-assessment in different units of the subject of Prevention and Public Health. We started on basic conceptual topics with the intention of gradually incorporate this system in all the matter.
   Once selected thematic units, the type of activity or exercise that we considered most suitable among the possibilities offered by the Moodle platform and developed the test, the students were invited to participate. Although initially for teachers the update, selection and preparation of material for exercises or tests to propose could be considered as a overload work, and despite being a short experience, it has been a very positive and satisfactory practice. We have obtained a favorable response from students, who have been encouraged to seek answers and request on-line and face to face tutorials which indicate a greater interest and involvement in their education.
   For all that reasons, we consider the e-assessment can be a valuable learning strategy which allows work additional formative aspects with students individually and in groups.

DE Higher education; effective learning; excellence; motivation; autonomous
   work
AB This communication describes the work developed at Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV) for the last two years by a team of lecturers called GRIPAU (Interdisciplinary Group for University Learning). GRIPAU is an interdisciplinary group of nine lecturers whose research is based on promoting innovation and improvement of learning quality in higher education. The main objective of GRIPAU is to develop new active methods to increase student's motivation, and to favour student's effective learning.
   In 2010, in the framework of this group, it was identified that students in higher education tend to fail in developing an authentic and effective learning. It was also observed that students do not think about the way they are learning, and this lack of reflection generates a lack of motivation towards the learning process. According to this scenario, GRIPAU decided to conduct different experiences focus on developing active learning methodologies to promote the significant learning of the students. As a result, a common strategy with support of ICTs (Information and Communication Technology) was developed and applied to different areas of knowledge under an institutional Innovation Project entitled "The student's reflection as an efficient strategy to promote effective learning". The overall perception of the lectures involved in this project was that the common methodology applied had been a real success, promoting the reflection of students and its autonomous work.
   Next, GRIPAU took a step forward on his career developing the educational innovation described in this communication, entitled "Development of emotional strategies to promote the students excellence". The ambitious objective of this strategy is to promote excellent learning and the integral development of students. An excellent learning may be defined not only considering theoretical contents, but also the development of certain skills, sensitization with their environment or development of critical thinking. To this aim, a series of specific cognitive and emotional strategies have been defined in order to potentially enhance this learning. These strategies have been applied in eight subjects belonging to very different areas of knowledge, such as agronomy, food technology, fine arts, architecture, forest and environmental sciences and telecommunications, and evaluated using a common methodology consisting in surveys to students at the beginning and at the end of the course. In general, the methodologies used in this study were positively rated by students and a tendency to improve the development of certain cross competences was detected, demonstrating that enhancing student's reflection on his own learning is an effective strategy to motivate students and to promote an excellent learning. In this work detailed information about the approach followed in this educational research is provided. Moreover, results and systematic evidences are presented in order to demonstrate the success of the proposed methodology.

AB Since the creation of Twitter in 2006, it became the biggest and most popular way of microblogging. Twitter has nowadays strong potential to enhance learning, providing outlets to improve professor-student (P2S) and student-student (S2S) communication and relationship. In order to succeed in it, we recommend educators to prepare their students for Information and Communication Technologies (ITC), social media and e-communication, so as to be ready for the current, real world. The purpose of this study was to examine the responses in their learning process and motivation of High Education students after a 4-month experience using Twitter as an educational tool. The conclusions we drew were all relative to the uses and knowledge of Twitter and social networks, and its connection with education. Due to their high average scores, we can say the current undergraduates are very skilled or even experts on new technologies. They rely on Twitter to connect people and information by sharing links, and appreciate the immediacy they are provided with. They do not consider Twitter as the best way to learn, because they do not want it to replace Moodle or email and the traditional evaluations.

AB Higher education is changing at a very fast rate and the current university professor has not had time to think about what can provide the new technologies in the field of education.
   The different technologies have been coming one after the other very quickly. Teachers, in addition to mastering the subject they teach (required training) and to know how to teach it (enough training), they must be formed in the field of ICT and apply them to university teaching.
   The institution, UPV, through the Institute of Education Sciences, offers a series of courses/workshops for both pedagogical training and e-learning tools to teachers. However, the transfer of this knowledge gained to teaching practice is not always immediate and requires dedication and effort by the teacher. Given that attending these courses is voluntary, and in many cases, training in these areas is a selftaught learning, this transfer takes place as the teacher learns by trial and error method.
   The vision of a university professor is presented in this paper based on own experiences as a user of ICT and in particular of the UPV PoliformaT platform. This indispensable tool today offers many possibilities, from the basic function of holding the notes subject to the conduct of examinations. It also contributes significantly to autonomous student learning and without any doubt also influences the teacher-student relationship.
   The objective of this paper is to contribute own experiences of using PoliformaT to make the reader reflect on this subject.

AB The introduction of Information and Communication technologies (ICT) in the classrooms has generated a series of changes in the approaches to the teaching-learning process. This has evolved into the appearance and development of many technologies and emergent pedagogies at the service of the teacher. It is necessary to encourage teacher training on ICT through the interaction of three great dimensions: discipline, pedagogy and technology. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the perception of a group of 82 students of the subject "New methodologies for the teaching of History", part of the Degree of Teacher of Primary Education at Albacete, in which, from the TPACK model as an intervention approach, they had to create their own materials and digital contents. The research developed has been described, following a mixed model, including characteristics from qualitative and quantitative models. The methodology of intervention was applied from an active and dynamic approach, based on Learning Based in Problems and on the TPACK model. The results have shown high values on the organization of the subject, the methodology applied, the quality, and the usefulness of the technological tools used. The results also highlight the benefits of fostering teacher training on ICT aimed at creating self-production of digital contents in teacher initial training.

AB From immemorial times the human being has had the need to organize and describe his world and so the graphic representations have been one of the best ways to achieve that end as shown by rock paintings. The scientific illustration has gone together with the process of birth and development of the Natural Sciences. Among the most significant milestones of the history of the Biological Sciences it is possible to find graphic productions that have been vital to explain the scientific constructions that have been developing. Despite the fact that the drawing in the field of the science is also a form of art, it is differentiated from the artistic drawing considering the simple but necessary correspondence that there should be with the natural world that intends to explain and describe. In the current scientific publications drawing and picture complement each other, they are not mutually exclusive. The new technologies and digital support strengthen and widen the possibilities of the classical scientific illustration and photography. The teaching and learning of the Natural Science at intermediate levels, should necessarily demand the use of scientific illustration. Science is learnt by reading and writing within it, as well as observing and drawing. The photography in practical laboratory activities, carried out by the students themselves and with the use of technological elements of everyday use ( for example, cell phones), is a highly advisable pedagogical tool to teach science.

AB The results of an educational project aimed at promoting the development of critical thinking and promote interest in experimental sciences in High Schools and College students is presented. In this paper, we made a compilation of several activities, which ways of integrating information technology and communication (ICT) in various experiments of science, which together can be used to implement a low cost "classroom-laboratory". With ICT we refer to the convergence of computers, software, audiovisual systems, Internet, telephone, and other equipment that integrates with some of these devices. To this end, several projects were developed, that can be transferred to high schools and colleges settings, with limited financial resources, as is frequent in Latin America. The projects highlight the methodological aspects of science and seek to integrate areas such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer science, art, etc. They aim to answer the questions: how do we know this?, why do we believe in that? These questions illustrate the nature of scientific thought. With the advent of programs such as "One Laptop per Child" that are being implemented in several Latin American countries, it is appropriate to use these resources as a basis to generate low cost laboratories. This contribution may be a useful tool to improve the quality of science learning and to encourage vocations in science and engineering. Furthermore, the development of a critical thinking, along with acquisition of skills in the use of ICT, can be essential in many academic and professional fields.

DE Active learning; ICT
AB Our college has already started flipped learning in the classes of some subjects underlying engineering, more specifically, mathematics, physics, chemistry, applied mathematics and applied physics. These subjects are taking a central role in promoting active learning in our college. In 2013, we introduced ICT-driven equipment into the laboratory classrooms of physics, chemistry and applied physics. By implementing this equipment, we are practicing active learning (flipped learning). Traditional flipped learning applied at home and abroad is based on the classroom lecture. On the other hand, from the standpoint that the education of Colleges of Technology is characterized by practical science, our college has created the environment for a new type of active learning (flipped learning) where classroom lectures and experimental practices are combined. In some cases of flipped learning, students use study materials written in English for preparation. And so, our college is promoting the teaching of English related to engineering as well.

AB A teacher adapted to the informational society is aware of the professional skills required by it, getting actively involved in continuing education activities. The aim of the introduction of the digital competences in the teaching activity is to improve the complex teaching-learning-evaluation process, through the adaptation of the curriculum specific for each discipline to the demands of the knowledge-based informational society. This approach supposes the habilitation of the teachers with specific competences regarding the use, improvement and continuous adaptation of the ICT methods and instruments. The design and the realization of the continuous training activities need to be based on the results of some qualitative and quantitative analyses, which concern the teachers' real training needs.
   Our study aims to analyze the training needs of the teachers that teach disciplines from the curricular area Mathematics and Natural Sciences in order to design, accredit and implement some continuing education programs as part of the PROWEB project - Teachers' continuing education network for the use of multimedia, virtual tools and web 2.0 in the curricular area of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (ID-141587).
   In this context, 100 teachers from the primary education, lower and higher secondary education, have been invited to take part in a survey. The objectives of the training needs analysis concerned: the identification of the level of their digital professional skills; the identification of the correlation degree between it and the training needs of the teachers involved in the curricular area Mathematics and Natural Sciences, imposed by the new changes generated by the present reforms; the identification of the teachers' perception regarding the skills/training level necessary to assure the quality of education, in general, and especially for an increased efficiency of the education process.

AB The topic of this paper reflects the real needs and stipulated priorities within foreign language teaching at the Faculty of Economics and Management of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. One of the priorities in the field of education is the reduction of the lecturer's direct teaching load, which is connected with the use of modern ICT technologies, e-learning courses for full-time forms of studies, for distance studies and for the centres of lifelong learning outside Prague. For the purposes of the research, the e-learning course was developed.
   The objective of the research was to find out students' opinion on e-learning depending on the frequencies of their responses and on their qualitative signs.
   Statistically significant differences in the responses to questions are supposed to be caused by the personal experience of the students, who took part in the e-learning course and who could better judge the questions, and on the other hand, by the lack of experience of those who did not take part in the course. Most students who took part in the course supported the inclusion of the e-learning course in the distance studies and thought that the studies through the e-learning method could be as effective as through the face-to-face method.

AB The motives for this research are the results of PISA, which reflect that the secondary students in Spain achieve low results in science learning and they have a lack of motivation. A teaching experience was carried out with students of the third secondary year, between 14 and 15 years of age. The research has taken advantage of the groups made by the school center, which homogenously distributes the students into three classes. The subject in question was Physics and Chemistry and the contents were density, pressure, volume, temperature and heat. The goal of this research is to measure the interest of the students in Physics and their reasons for the same before the experience with a motivational pretest. Later, the contents were given through different methodologies. One group followed the traditional methodology, another followed cooperative learning and another was explained through the use of technologies (ICT) following exposition teaching. After these classes, a motivational post-test was done to observe the changes. We conclude that the students of the cooperative group and ICT have had a motivational change that is much more positive than that of the traditional group.

AB The ability to find information and how to process it is one of the main challenges of education in the information society where vast amounts of information are easily available. Process information implies testing its reliability, reaching a diagnosis about its accuracy and/or combining information if it comes from different sources or has peculiarities that require verification. Collaboration between diverse cultural institutions such as archives, museums and libraries is substantially important and future teachers of primary and secondary schools should teach how to acquire these skills. In the Teacher Training College BAM (Bilbao) it is offered a subject shared by the BAM, the Archive and the Museum named "Laboratory of active methods for interdisciplinary learning sciences" which is included in the Curriculum of Primary Education pathway in curricular deepening (6ECTS). During the course of this subject, students take part in various workshops where they create scientific-didactic materials for social and natural sciences where the use of ICT ' s is fundamental. Students work in projects and use ICT-s with the aim of making real the comprehensive rethinking of teaching and learning that is needed which highlights innovation and multidisciplinary.

AB 3D Virtual Labs are the support of learning, a tool of education in the future. Learning in a 3D environment allows greater interaction with contents in a unique way as students perceive it as being really there. Simulations are being designed, a combination of real-world environment with the information supplied by devices, where measurements can be replicated and data analyzed. This study presents a virtual scenario of a Measurements and Instrumentation laboratory.
   Electrical Engineering courses aim to train students to succeed in meeting the challenges within competitive and ever-changing professional contexts. In order to prepare undergraduate students for ongoing success, the courses must provide effective training in the application and development of practices, typically implemented in large projects and organizations. Developing high quality engineering course units is definitely a challenging task.
   Courses can be provided remotely, but careful planning is required to design quality course units because problems may occur in meeting quality targets. The developments in information and communication technologies (ICT), including multimedia and internet-based education platforms, facilitate the creation of reliable solutions to these challenges. Studies show that a smart application of multimedia technologies and web-based education platforms can provide great results towards better quality of engineering courses. Many challenges on how to suitably approach the educational process have already been put forward. Higher Education institutions use multiple approaches to teaching and learning, combining a range of methods, including e-learning, videoconferencing, face-to-face teaching and hard-copy resources in course delivery.
   The authors present a software model for engineering, which is based mainly on the Wirefusion (R) software, and a virtualreality platform called VEMA. The project intends to improve the quality of teaching and learning in higher education through effective application of information technologies and the sciences of learning.
   3D virtual learning environments arise as solutions to the extent that, in addition to offering features associated with communication and information sharing, they promote flexible learning spaces and moments. At the level of higher education, and in accordance with the paradigm of Bologna, virtual environments acquire special importance to allow learning beyond the classroom time and space.

AB In the first year of medical studies in France, students prepare for a highly selective entrance exam limited by numerus clausus into the second year. We have discontinued live lectures, made maximum use of new information and communication technologies and introduced tutorials in an attempt to make the first year more equitable and to personalise teaching. The reform is based on blended learning with flipped classroom organized into a four-week cycles of different activities. Each cycle corresponds to a learning module. The teachers' and students' opinions were analysed to evaluate the reforms and allow teaching methods to be adapted accordingly. The student profiles at registration and success in the exams following the reform are described. The tutorial's notes are correlated to the final scores at the entrance exam. The keys to success seem to be modified by the reform providing greater equality of opportunity between students. The factors associated to success are baccalaureate highest grades, high School Specialisation (maths, physics or earth and life sciences) and repeating the first year class. The use of blended learning allows us to face the increase of student enrolment, and to facilitate the acceptance of these pedagogical methods for both students and teachers.

AB The incorporation of Spain into the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has required a thorough change in the university education system. For example, teachers have had to strive to develop activities that encourage independent, active and collaborative learning. To adapt to this new concept of teaching, e-learning and b-learning strategies through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) are some of the most used practices.
   The b-learning methodology, which combines face-to-face and distance activities, has been implemented in two subjects ("General and Organic Chemistry" and "Agricultural Chemistry and Analysis") taught in the Agricultural Engineering Degree at the Technical University of Madrid.
   Before the implementation of the new degrees, laboratory classes were only performed on-campus because no multimedia material was available. In order to give the students the necessary supporting materials that favor the autonomous acquisition of knowledge and skills as well as increase their motivation and improve their performance, a total of 11 laboratory practical classes have been recorded in 10 minute videos comprising different sections (basic principles, reagents, materials and equipment, the use of computer applications, etc.).
   Teachers have evaluated the effectiveness of this method as a learning tool as well as its acceptance by students. Students, via the Moodle platform for each subject, must watch the video and fill-out a multiple-choice questionnaire before being able to carry out the class in the laboratory. Once in the laboratory, the teacher will assess the students' performance and the results obtained and then, as a final step, feedback is provided by the students regarding the usefulness of the video and questionnaires.
   The students' results show that the activity allows them to increase their sense of ownership of their learning and their motivation and improve their knowledge of laboratory techniques and theoretical and practical principles. Feedback from the students shows that more than 80% believe that the videos enhance the understanding of each practical lesson; their duration is appropriate and the multiple-choice questions are useful for self-assessment of their learning.

AB Several authors have addressed the need to adapt teaching and learning processes at the European Higher Education Area through the use of new teaching methods, including the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), which play a prominent role as a teaching resource. According with this idea, some authors have pointed out the need of implementing ICTs in teaching. However, it is also important to consider the possibility of access to and the use of these ICTs by university students. Thus, the teacher would improve the learning situations, making them closer, adapted and motivating for students, identifying the different profiles and controlling the use of certain technological resources by students. Having in mind this situation, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the use of ICTs in a group of students of the subject "Analytical Chemistry II" (ACII), coursed in the second year of Pharmacy Degree, in order to know their relationship with ICTs access and improve the planning of the teaching of this course. In order to achieve this objective students completed a questionnaire about the access and use of different ICTs at the beginning of the course. 126 students (2 groups of theory of ACII) filled the questionnaire. It was found that 100% of students had a mobile phone (Smartphone 73%), although 8.7% expressed not to have Internet access in the classroom with the phone. In addition, 44.4% of the students used an electronic device different to mobile phone (PC or tablet) in class. Only 53.8% of them had access to Internet in the classroom with the electronic device used. 3.2% of students claimed not to know any program for making presentations on the computer and "powerpoint" was the most known program among students (41.3%). Finally, 55.6% of students had never used interactive response control in the classroom. The obtained results highlight the fact that although ICTs must be implanted in teaching, there is still a high percentage of students who are not familiar with the use of these technologies within the classroom. For this reason, teachers have to motivate students to encourage their use.

AB The European convergence process has led to major changes in the university setting. In the new context, the student training focuses on learning abilities and methodologies. Furthermore, the acquisition and development of competencies by the students are in the spotlight. Hence, the teacher role has changed from a principal actor to a facilitator of learning. Thus, the implementation of the new degrees has involved a design of courses based on general and specific competencies and learning objectives.
   This work describes the methodology followed in the development of a teaching innovation project approved in the course 2012/13 at the University of Burgos. The main objective of the project is the development of training materials for the acquisition of generic skills by students in the Degree in Food Science and Technology and in the Degree in Chemistry. This objective involved the yielding of training activities and assessment procedures for five transversal skills (oral skills in academic/scientific presentations, spoken and written English in Science, writing scientific reports, collaborative working and ICT management) to provide the teachers with the tools to assist them in the evaluation of their students.

AB Developing, using and assessing systems within the Educational Informatics field require its professionals to deepen their theoretical and methodological knowledge. To achieve excellence in the process of professional training, a systematic education transcending any short course focused only in the use of some of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools is needed.
   In this sense, The Faculty of Exact Sciences and Technologies of the National University of Santiago del Estero, Argentina aims to create a local environment for academic reflection where knowledge generation and production is promoted. Thus, among other actions, the "Master in Educational Informatics" Graduate Program was first run this year.
   This paper aims to present the design and implementation of a pedagogical proposal for the education of virtual tutors. The experience was developed along the "Virtual Learning Environments" Module included in the first year of the Program and whose objectives are: to get knowledge of the various Virtual Learning Environments (VELs) and of the criteria for their evaluation; to investigate on new trends; to gain expertise in the use of one VEL in particular.
   Its targeted learners are graduates from Informatics Programs of the Faculty that currently teach at any educational level.
   In designing the proposal the learning objectives related to those of the module, the socio-cultural context, the contents included in the study plan, the competencies inherent to a virtual tutor, and the graduate's profile were all taken into account systematically.
   The methodological strategy was oriented towards a seminary-workshop modality with an on-going evaluation. In the seminar the main concepts related to the VLEs were discussed, individual and group monographic assignments were developed. In the workshop, the participants were proposed to revisit their own classroom teaching proposals that they impart in their contexts to now move them into a VLE.
   The virtual activities were carried out on the Moodle Platform and combined with the in-person encounters. The implementation of the course was monitored out of data recording and observation of the students' performance.
   First the results from the diagnosis test are introduced. The test aimed to verify the learners' level of preparation to understand the contents of the module and to know their expectations about it.
   Then the individual and group activities, the accompanying and evaluating processes and the final project of the workshop are described. To analyze the experience as "virtual education tutor" gained by the students in terms of both the competencies and skills acquired a survey was designed and conducted. Later the analysis of the results obtained in terms of the learning quality criteria is shown.
   At last the conclusions highlighting the high level of knowledge gained by the participants and the valuation of the VLE pedagogical and technical potentialities are drawn. As a future research line is posited the creation of a tutor-learner collaborative space where the decision-making process defining a formative strategy that potentiates ICTs-based learning can be analyzed.

ID BELIEFS
AB Different investigations point out that beliefs are an important aspect to consider when designing and implementing the curriculum [1, 2, 3]. In the Chilean educational context the relationship that exists between teaching and thinking of the science teacher(biology, physics and chemistry) has been described, especially in relation to what to teach (content), how to teach (methodology) and what and how to evaluate(evaluation) [4, 5]. Along these lines, it has been researched how the relationship between thinking and the teaching practice of teachers is, in regard to ICT. Specifically, what type of ICTs are used in class and in practical activities, with what purpose and what the relation of these aspect with what teachers think is in respect to the ICTs. The main findings show that science teachers think that the use of ITs is adequate and beneficial to the teaching and learning of science, however, for both the design and development of their classes, it has been observed little use. In fact, teachers believe that ICTs must be used for the teaching of science, but in class the most used resource is the textbook [6]. All in all, we can point out there are differences, between what teachers think and what they do in class [7].
   We consider that these findings are useful, for both improving the teaching of science and the mathematic and to improve the initial teaching training of high school teachers who will be teaching science. In this context, we present part of a wider investigation originated in teachers in service, related to initial teaching training of high school science teachers (Fondecyt 11130150), proposing instruments to explore thinking and pedagogical-curricular knowledge of future teachers. For this, with a mix methodology, we worked with a sample of 303 teachers in service and, besides we administered a Likert like questionnaire and varied quantitative techniques to analyze the information gathered. The results show that the thinking of teachers tends to be constructivist and is organized in different levels according to the curricular aspect being tackled (contents, methodology and/or evaluation). Nevertheless, in regard to the teaching practice they show a traditional tendency and practice. We consider that our findings have implications on the training of teachers, especially when the current context reveals the development of pedagogical competencies for the teaching of science

DE Education; communication technologies; the role of technology
AB Today communication concept, which has a great revolution with the printing press which has been found by Gutenberg, has no boundary thanks to advanced communication devices and the internet. it is possible to take advantage in many areas, such as from medicine to social sciences or from mathematics to education, from the computers that firstly was produced for the purpose of military services. The use of these developing technologies in the field of education has created a great vision changes in both training and having education. Materials, which can be consider as basic communication resources and used in traditional education has begun to lose its significance, and some technoloies has begun to replace of them such as internet, computers, smart boards, projection devices and mobile phone. On the other hand, the programs and applications used in these technologies have also been developed. University students use virtual books instead of the traditional printed book, use cell phones instead of note books, use the Internet and virtual databases instead of the library to research. They even submit their homework with interactive methods rather than printed materials. The traditional education system, these technologies, which increase productivity, have brought a new dimension to education. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of technologies in the learning process of students and to find whether is there any similarities and differences that arise from the their faculty that they have been educated and and their learning process. In addition to this, it is aimed to determine the level of ICT usage of students studying at the university level. In this context, the advantages and conveniences of the technology used by students are also scrutinized. In this study it is used surveys to collect the data.

AB The paper presents the results of preliminary research aimed at the diagnosis of the level of competency of students beginning their academic education in the fields of social sciences and the humanities, concerning their preparation for activity in the digital learning environment. The present study took into account the skills of being active in the digital environment in terms of the educational process. For the purposes of the present study, the main areas of competency in the field of ICT were specified, in which the respondents rated the level of their skills. The distinguished areas of competency are the basis for proper functioning in the world of the new media and the process of lifelong learning. Information and digital competencies, analysed in the paper, are considered to be the elements of information culture understood as a sphere of human activity shaped by information awareness, values in support of the need for information literacy and attitudes that cause behaviour characteristic of information mature users, resulting from the interaction between the abovementioned components of culture.

AB If universities are supported by the communities in which they are embedded, then solving their communities' problems must be a critical university ethical goal. The essay's first part examines philosophy's roles in directing university research in such disciplines as the natural and social sciences, history, art and mathematics. Of particular interest are the roles that information and communication technology (ICT) might play in the dissemination of research results in universities' supporting communities. The Pan-African thinker W.E.B. Du Bois believed that virtually all humans are capable of profiting from a university education. ICT must be critical to African universities' discharge of their ethical responsibilities to their communities. The first part's conclusion suggests three ways whereby African universities may advance toward Du Bois's goal. The essay's second part proposes a curriculum for Fort Hare University in Alice and East London in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province. As both an urban and rural university, Fort Hare presents a unique opportunity for examining university-community relationships. The essay's conclusion argues that African universities must play a critical role in constructing African self-knowledge. Critical to university and alumni contributions to re-thinking African identity, will be the inclusion of curricular material specific to the cultures of communities selected for university outreach.

AB Currently, the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT) has been strongly recommended to science teachers. For ident!fication the factors of successful ICT implementation the Un!fied Theory of Use and Acceptance of Technology (UTAUT) is applied, which works as the theoretical background of planned monitoring of Czech chemistry teachers' attitudes to this problem. This theoretical review introduces the process of creating the modified UTAUT model serving as the basis for a research tool to be exploited for the future survey. Within this process three sources were exploited: (1) theories dealing with factors which influence user behaviour in relation to the use of modern technologies, (2) the analysis of research results focused on the acceptance and use of ICT in chemistry instruction and (3) results of researches conducted by the authors in the field of the effectiveness of the educational software used in chemistry teaching and learning. The conducted analysis of these three sources resulted in defining the presented survey and designing the appropriate theoretical model and research tool.

AB An upper-division organic chemistry laboratory experiment exploring fluorescent sensing over two laboratory periods and part of a third is described. Two functionally distinct pH-responsive sensors are prepared through a dehydrative three-component coupling reaction. During the abbreviated (<1 h) first laboratory period, students set up reactions to prepare the two compounds. The second period involves purification using salt metathesis and characterization using standard techniques. The third period is spent exploring the fluorescent characteristics of the two compounds through visual (eye) and fluorometer analysis of solutions at varying pH. The two sensors show either a "turn-on" (photoinduced electron transfer, PET) or "ratiometric" (intramolecular charge transfer, ICT) response to protonation with these distinctions deriving from sterically induced differences in conformation. This experiment is appropriate for demonstrating steric effects on reactivity and macroscopic properties, multicomponent coupling reactions, carbonyl reactivity, aromatization, purification of ionic organic molecules, absorbance and emission of light by organic molecules, frontier molecular orbital theory, and fluorescence sensing.

AB Currently not many people would doubt that computers play an essential role in both public and private life in many countries. However, somewhat surprisingly, evidence of computer use is difficult to find in German state schools although other countries have managed to implement computer-based teaching and learning in their schools. This paper attempts to understand the reasons for this phenomenon and to show that more research and development on computer-based teaching and learning should be done. It starts with some comments on the importance of computer-based learning, followed by a description of the development of ICT in education since the 1990s in Germany and the general situation at public schools. After focusing on the frame of educational policy in Germany, the situation in schools, including the person of the teacher, is then reflected upon and compared to the situation in other countries. Finally, current developments of computerbased learning in chemistry education in Germany are discussed and a frame of further research is proposed.

AB Background: Both academics and practitioners agree that critical thinking skills are necessary to provide safe and comprehensive nursing care. In order to promote the development of critical thinking, nurse educators need to keep the teaching/learning process captivating and interesting using active learning environments. These can be implemented by using modern information and communication technologies that are simple, fun, and time and cost effective.
   Objectives: The goal of our study was to design and test an approach, which allows individual and fast acquisition of critical thinking skills with the use of information and communication technology.
   Design: A combination of qualitative and quantitative research design was implemented. The study consisted of a quasi-experiment (phases 1-3): (1) pre-test discussion board, (2) use of e-contents based on the presented approach, and (3) post-test discussion board. The participants' opinion about the presented approach was identified in phase 4.
   Settings: The study was performed in May 2012 during the course "Ethics and Philosophy in Nursing" at the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Primorska, Slovenia.
   Participants: Forty first-year undergraduate nursing students.
   Methods: Qualitative analysis of the discussion boards (phases 1,3) and an anonymous survey with open- and closed-ended questions (phase 4).
   Results: Qualitative analysis of the discussion boards showed a significant (p < 0.001) improvement in the percentage of posts (12.2%) for which the opinions and conclusions of the participants were justified with valid arguments. The survey results indicated that participants perceived the e-contents based on the presented approach as useful, and that they improved their critical thinking skills.
   Conclusions: Repeated confirmation of the validity of the presented approach through methodological triangulation represents a strong indication that the presented approach is a valuable tool to develop nursing students' critical thinking skills. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Electrochemistry topic is found to be difficult to learn due to its abstract concepts involving macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic representation levels. Studies have shown that animation and simulation using information and communication technology (ICT) can help students to visualize and hence enhance their understanding in learning abstract chemistry topics. As a result, an interactive multimedia module with the pedagogical agent (IMMPA) named the EC Lab (Electrochemistry Lab) was developed in order to assist students in the learning of Electrochemistry topics. A non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design investigation was carried out in order to gauge the effect of the IMMPA EC Lab on students' understanding and motivation in the learning of Electrochemistry. Some 127 Form Four students from two secondary schools in one of the districts in Malaysia were involved in the study. Each school had one treatment group and one control group taught by the same Chemistry teacher. Instruments involved were a pre- and posttest, a pre- and post-motivation questionnaire, and the IMMPA EC Lab. Results showed a significant difference between the control groups and treatment groups in the understanding of concepts in the learning of Electrochemistry.

DE Computer Simulation; Computer Supported Chemistry Instruction; Delphi
   Method; Expert Evaluation
AB Computer models have been penetrating the school chemistry instruction as a result of ICT implementation in education. The computer models of identical content differ in technical processing, interactivity type or degrees of freedom. We suppose that different characteristics provide impact on application the computer models into the process of instruction, on selection of pedagogic design of the lesson and learning objectives - reaching the objectives should be supported by the computer model. Our research included expert evaluation by the two-round Delphi method totally three computer models of acid-base titration presenting the same content in different technical designs. The evaluation form was designed based on questioning and scaling. Computer models were evaluated in three fields in relation to pre-defined set of learning objectives, the level of processing and applicability in the instruction. The expert evaluation was provided by 17 experts in chemistry instruction. The collected data were analysed by quartile graphs. The results of analysis showed (1) the evaluated computer models dispose of different potential in reaching learning objectives in acid-base titration topic in relation to technical design and (2) the different technical design of the computer models of acid-base titration provides impact on the recommended pedagogical design of instruction.

DE Early Chemistry Instructio; Didactics Software; Instruction Efficiency;
   Interactive Whiteboard
AB The paper presents results of the two-year survey focusing on the efficiency of using didactic software on the interactive whiteboard within chemistry instruction on the lower secondary school level compared to the traditional process of instruction where ICT are not implemented. Phase 1 focuses on the explanation and practising/fixing knowledge of chemical nomenclature of inorganic acids and hydroxides. The survey in the first phase was based on the quasi-experiment, where the ICT-supported and non/ICT-supported process of instruction were alternately applied, i.e. the interactive board and 3M didactic software "Didakta-chemie" versus no ICT used in the process of instruction. The didactic tests of our own design were applied for verification. In phase 2 we dealt with efficiency of the didactic software for final revision of knowledge in the field of inorganic chemical nomenclature. The survey was based on the traditional pedagogical experiment where the didactic software "Didakta - Chemie" on the interactive board was the independent variable and the dependent variable was defined by learners' results in the above mentioned d didactic tests. The experimental group proved higher level of knowledge immediately after the instruction, while no statistically significant differences in experimental and control group were detected in retention tests.

   Training and development; professional education
AB The principal aim of this study is to identify the threats and opportunities face by the library education movement in Sri Lanka with special reference to Department of Library and Information Science (DELIS), University of Kelaniya Sri Lanka. The paper explores how the DELIS could counter these threats with the help of curriculum development strategies. Objectives of the study were to identify what is library education movement, to study threats and factors affecting library education with special reference to DELIS, to explore how DELIS overcome these threats and to develop a model of a curriculum design system. Methodology adopted in the study comprised the analysis of vision, mission, stakeholder, content and SWOT. The factors and threats affecting the library education in Sri Lanka can be categorized in to two aspects as macro and micro. Macro aspects are non-recognition and non-identification of the library sector in the government hierarchy particularly the higher education sector, dubious bureaucracy, and lack of cooperation among the principal library education contributors. Micro aspects of threats are the grass root level factors. These threats are rapidly changing subject knowledge content and relevancy, lack of communication and ICT skills among the Library and Information Science (LIS) students, perennial decrease of library science students' intake, negative thinking and attitudes among LIS professionals. Identifying this critical situation, the DELIS is in the process of revising its LIS curriculum drastically suiting to the current demands and requirement in the Student Centered Learning context. The others are the inclusion of extraordinary course units, revising curriculum at every four year period, empowerment of industrial training component, identification of series of competencies, allocation of more ICT course units, inclusion of project based English course unit at every semester, introduction of more practical project based course unites particularly in Classification, Cataloguing, compilation of bibliographic tools and Literature survey project reports in Science and Technology, Social Sciences and Humanities. ICT, communication, management and language skills are some of the essential soft skills which should inculcate among the undergraduates. It is proposed to empower the curriculum evaluation process and further propose to set up a Curriculum Revision Committee with the representation from the principal library education contributors in Sri Lanka, library professionals and the government and private sector. It is observed that a benchmark system introduced so far has to be revised accordingly. These are some of the new strategies in the curriculum development in the Department and they could be applied in the other curriculum development processes.

AB Taking a look on previously e-Learning developments on geo-information science there are some observations: (1) Most of the projects were focused on creating teaching materials and tutorials that presented implementation techniques used in geospatial information about data acquisition, storage and processing; (2) Few projects concerned with experimentation and extensibility; (3) Few projects deal with the resources necessary in the creation of ability to develop Earth Observation applications: repositories of data, old archives, previously experiments, how to access, what formats, etc. And only few projects are however dealing with providing lessons on how to develop real casebased applications for Earth Observation areas using new information technologies and communications, but also geospatial technologies. In general, each technology provider offers its users a lot of tutorials that illustrate better facilities products. But missing from the market the e-Learning programs that provide techniques and methods for developing applications real cases-based following the experience in using integrated heterogeneous data sources and processing chains appropriate technology products to solve their vital problems such as, for example, real time decision making on how to manage the natural resources, how to manage the groundwater management aspects in urban planning or real time decision making the as reaction to the appearance and/or preventing the consequences of natural phenomena. The architecture discussed in this paper aims to fill this gap using the latest concepts in the field of ICT combined with the latest technologies in Earth Observation applications with the latest concepts and techniques in the field of geospatial information management. The paradigm proposed here is to learn by doing.

AB The paper is aimed at emphasizing the role of the project based learning using collaborative web environments. The research is based on the implementation of both andragogy and cybergogy paradigms in a specific learning context. The project based learning has been identified as an appropriate method for the adult education and for valorising the web tools facilities. Besides fostering cooperation and active learning, project-based learning methods facilitate creative and innovative approaches in solving problems and using knowledge in a concrete environment. The appropriateness of the method for the adult education, according to the principles of the andragogy, as well as the synergy with the cybergogy principles has been also revealed. The project based learning, as a collaborative method, has been applied in adult education, as a pilot research implemented at the ICT discipline, within the framework of a bachelor program, organised in the Faculty of Education Sciences in a private university. The intense use of the web space and tools for collaborative work has been also emphasized. The methodological approach encompasses desk research, implementation of new learning methods, direct observations of the learning process, organization of a survey for analysing the participants' feedback in relation with the innovative approach and the identification of the strong and weak points of the project based learning using collaborative web tools. In addition, the contribution of the new methodological approach to the development of the students' transversal competences has been also emphasized in direct connection with the increased graduates' employability. Thus, the paper summarizes the results of the research activities carried out during the educational process and presents the outcomes resulting from the implementation of the pilot module integrating project based learning and collaborative web tools, focusing on the students' perspectives about the advantages of the whole process.

AB Development of ICT in the educational process has brought a lot of positives. However, the negative financial situation in education brings with it the need to seek new learning opportunities, respectively need to seek to provide knowledge and skills by new form that would be relative inexpensive. In this paper, we focus on the possibility of using special modules LMS Moodle for support and development of intellectual abilities of students. Since the year 2009 the Department of Informatics (Faculty of Natural Sciences, Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Slovakia) aims to develop modules of 3 sides to facilitate learners in the studio easier to absorb discussed topic (study material). One of the modules which has been conditioned and successfully implemented in the educational process is module LogicSimMoodle. The module was originally programmed (by A. Tetzle, original name LogicSim) as a Java applet, but due to its simplicity and mass spread, decided we to modify this module for the possibility of its implementation in virtual learning environment - LMS Moodle. In this paper we describe verification of this module by using implementation through evaluation of the results of students from the viewpoint of learning efficiency. This module students actively are using from the Academic Year 2010/2011. The aim of the experiment was to compare the effectiveness of teaching and assess the quality of teaching based on the use of that module through subsequent analysis of variance. Students were divided into 2 groups: control and experimental. In the control group have all students studied classical way. In the experimental group of students was used new module LogocSimMoodle, to the need to develop their ability and skills.

AB The paper presents the analysis of level of skills and knowledge in ICT of first year bachelor freshmen that entered several study programmes in economy and technical fields at Czech University of Life Sciences in the academic year 2013/14. The main goal of the paper is to analyse the added value of learning in the informatics course among first year bachelor students. The analysis of the added value is based on data sampling (n=507) from entry test and examination test in ICT courses. Seven variables at the entry test and eight variables at the examination test were tested. Only gender and type of faculty had some influence on test scores. Differences between certain types of secondary schools and countries were also proved. We found that the level of acquired basic ICT knowledge and skills might be homogenized at bachelor level despite students' various backgrounds stemming from educational, geographical, demographical and even cultural differences in secondary education.

DE media usage habits; social media; mobile learning; engineering education
AB The usage of different kinds of media is part and parcel of teaching and learning processes in higher education. According to today's possibilities of information and communication technologies, mobile devices and app-usage have become indispensable for a big share of the population in everyday life. However, there is little empirical evidence on how students use mobile devices for learning processes in higher education, especially in engineering education. Within the project "Excellent Teaching and Learning in Engineering Sciences (ELLI)", three large technical universities (RWTH Aachen University, Ruhr-University Bochum, Technical University Dortmund) follow different approaches in order to improve the current teaching and learning situation in engineering education. Many of the corresponding measures are media-related. In this context, a broad understanding of media is applied which includes hardware as well as software. Amongst others, research is conducted on the topics of mobile learning, virtual laboratories, virtual collaboration, social media services and e-learning recommendation systems for teaching staff. In order to match the literature and results of the project with the current habits of study related media usage of students, the three universities conducted a survey in cooperation with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The KIT's questionnaire covers more than 50 education-related media and IT-Services and has been applied at over 20 universities in 6 countries. For the survey conducted within the ELLI project, the topic of mobile learning was added to the questionnaire. Over 1.500 students were asked about their habits of study related media usage in terms of frequency of use and level of satisfaction. Regarding the topic of mobile learning, the students were asked for the kind of hardware and the kind of apps they use for higher education purposes. The 130 identified apps were clustered regarding subject and function. This paper presents the main results concerning the students' general habits of study related media usage and their mobile learning habits. It concludes with a special focus on the possibilities mobile devices offer to the improvement of engineering education.

AB This article explores the ways a physical educational resource is transformed by ICT into a virtual learning material on the example of Ancient Greek sculptures at Zagreb's Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. The sculptures, acquired as casts from the originals in the British Museum and Louvre, serve as a learning resource in teaching museum study courses, while the results of this formal education provide a new learning material for an online environment. The theoretical framework is based on Laurillard's classification of educational media that facilitate participative learning in formal education and consequently in informal online heritage education.

AB Improvement of mathematical education and motivation of students in the mathematics' area is needed. What can be done? We introduce some ideas to generate the student's interest for mathematics, because they often present difficulties in appreciating the relevance of mathematics and its role in the health sciences. We consider that a cornerstone in the strategy to attract the students' interest is linking the mathematics with real biomedical situations. We proceed in the following manner: We first present a real biomedical situation to produce interest and to generate curiosity. Second, we ask thought-provoking questions to students as: Which is the biomedical problem presented? Which is my knowledge on this situation? What could I do to solve this biomedical situation? Do I need some new mathematical concepts and procedures? Thereupon, the teacher explains the mathematical concepts necessary to solve the case presented, providing definitions, properties and tools for graphical display and/or mathematical calculations. In this learning methodology, ICTs were cornerstones for reaching the proposed competences. Furthermore, ICTs can also be used in the evaluative task in its two possible aspects: formative and for obtaining a qualification. Comments from students about this new mathematics teaching method indicate that the use of real biomedical case studies kept the lessons in mathematics interesting. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB The complex phenomena in a global knowledge-based society and economy are causing difficulties in understanding by conventional modes. The economists should consequently analyse new phenomena. They need to build new theories and disseminating them to wide community. New results in cognitive sciences and progressing ICT, advances in applied informatics and computational intelligence there are arising new opportunities for a dialogue with mental models and theories in the economic sciences. In economics the creation of virtual laboratories and of simulation experimentation with them is useful, for the author uses name "Economic Softbot". He refers to the dialogue with such softbots as storytelling. The topic of the essay belongs to the class of emergent research/education/learning technologies. Their innovative power is in the dominance of constructive upon instructive approaches and based on holistic qualitative perception of the various complexities.

AB Volunteers have been trained to perform first-level inspections of hydraulic structures within campaigns promoted by civil protection of Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy). Two inspection forms and a learning session were prepared to standardize data collection on the functional status of bridges and check dams. In all, 11 technicians and 25 volunteers inspected a maximum of six structures in Pontebba, a mountain community within the Fella Basin. Volunteers included civil-protection volunteers, geosciences and social sciences students. Some participants carried out the inspection without attending the learning session. Thus, we used the mode of technicians in the learning group to distinguish accuracy levels between volunteers and technicians. Data quality was assessed by their accuracy, precision and completeness. We assigned ordinal scores to the rating scales in order to get an indication of the structure status. We also considered performance and feedback of participants to identify corrective actions in survey procedures. Results showed that volunteers could perform comparably to technicians, but only with a given range in precision. However, a completeness ratio (question/parameter) was still needed any time volunteers used unspecified options. Then, volunteers' ratings could be considered as preliminary assessments without replacing other procedures. Future research should consider advantages of mobile applications for data-collection methods.

AB Using Open Educational Resources (OER) provides opportunities for collaboration both in the classroom and beyond. Started in 2008 and gathering momentum over the past two years, now an online phenomenon, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) reunite different perspectives over a globalized online learning. The paper analyses the use of OER and MOOCs in different study cases in Romanian universities. Several OER initiatives resulted from the over 1000 academia involved in the DidaTec lifelong learning and training for higher education teachers in the technical sciences and engineering field as a training course for university professors in 12 universities, within the aim of improving the use of ICT in higher education. Four universities from Romania started a Romanian MOOC environment, the UniCampus, which provides free access to valuable education in Romanian language, presented by well-known professors. The evaluation and quality assurance challenges of the Unicampus are mainly due to the restrictive educational setting in Romania. Two study cases on blending MOOCs in traditional higher education courses at undergraduate and Master level are also analysed from the impact on students' motivation. Integrating MOOCs in blended learning empower students with new abilities and requires a new and open teacher model.

AB Background
   At present, the appearance of new technologies, information and communication technology (ICT) play a significant change in medical education. However, teachers and institutions maintain a traditional curricular position. Courses like pharmacology, which requires greater investments of time to develop theory and practice, needs to incorporate strategies in order to optimize the learning process.
   This sort of student-centred education, will be develop independent learning that could generate some degree of transformation in a traditional curriculum in itself.
   Objective
   The purpose of this study is to determine if the new educational approaches of e-learning and b-learning have been incorporated into the new teaching and learning strategies of the medical curricula, specifically in the pharmacology course.
   Materials and methods. This study investigated the longitudinal trends of implementation of e-learning and b-learning strategies in the pharmacology course in medical curriculum. Literature database of PubMed were searched by the terms "e learning medical", "medical curriculum" and "Pharmacology". The study eligibility criteria included articles published in English. One hundred and two (102) articles were identified and included for the initial analysis in the period from 1993 to 2013.
   Results.
   61 publications with e-learning and 41 b-learning were identified apllied to pharmacology interventions. We identified that traditional didactic education is limited in providing opportunity for student-case patient pharmacology learning. Designed situations in pharmacology can enhance learners' knowledge and associated abilities through a variety of activities.
   Active learning is a student centered rather than a teacher-centred process; it makes learners responsible for their own learning by self-directed, peer-assisted seeking of new information. Pharmacology e-Learning is a relatively new approach to medical education rapidly growing in the last ten years. A learning management system (LMS) makes it possible to monitor the access and progress of learners through the content, as well as assessing their process teaching learning aplied to pharmacology courses. Pharmacology teachers and their institutions might also see if e-Learning and b-learning are a costeffective option, although this depends on the numbers of learners and a plan for sustainability of the material.
   Educational studies and projects and e-learning or b-learning application in pharmacology courses are growing with the highest potential for future research, and is important to know that e-learning differ between leading countries and early adopter countries, and government policies play an important role in this aspect.
   Conclusion.
   The didactic strategy type e-learning and b-learning, has been incorporated into the program plans of health sciences in higher education, and specifically to pharmacology.

AB Learning Community isn't a new concept, but still a new or renewable trend of pedagogical practices in educational contexts in view of the emergency of a culture in which everyone is involved in a collective effort. Successful higher education must open itself to a process of helping young people to better understand the world and be educationally empowered to contribute to society [1]. In this alignment, Bologna' reform highlight comfort locus to learning communities, communities of practice or communities of inquiry. However, while there is horizontal consistency in curriculum intentions about the competences to lead the 21st century across different frameworks, converging on a common set of skills and stressing the importance of collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social and cultural competences including citizenship, and also mentioning creativity, critical thinking, productivity and problem-solving, the procedures to get those intentions implemented are largely diverse, fuzzy or hindering. This project aims to proceed with the academic goal of creating an active learning community that turns effective the cooperation and collective, concurrently to self-regulated learning; conscientiousness of the societal needs and at the same time shared awareness and networking in solving real problems. The foundation of a Community of Active Learning on the principles of experiential and collaborative learning looks for knowledge transfer to solve problems situated in the larger society. Such a Community will operate as a center service for people and organizations, coping with problems or challenges polarized in an operational research unit or projects management of multidisciplinary initiative. In the basis of the projects-design will be the involvement of the three scientific areas lectured at the University Department where the Community is rooted (Psychology, Sciences of Education and Social Work). But all university community is invited to collaborate. The projects listed from situational analysis or stakeholders requests will be organized in systematic data-bases opened up to all the potential collaborators (students, academic experts, partners). The Community should be sustainable on the emphasis of diverse literacies, through a participatory and innovative combinatorial design of tools for developing and evaluating learning processes. Privilege is given to "innovative" tools and strategies, such as technological enhanced learning and game based learning methods. Inserting a non-formal learning device into a classical educational structure we believe we are contributing to updating the vertical consistency in a paradigm that clusters knowledge and skills of psycho-social-educational agents into situated learning projects that are significant for all the academic, scientific or civilian subsystems. The results of this project in progress, which we present here for discussion, are the basics of the Learning Community Logic Model for make it transformational. This developmental guide to innovate higher education outlines involvement practices, profiling a strategic approach, by preventing resources, requirements and predicting the impact of the project to the kick off a community specializing in Serious Games.

AB Spanish universities are currently undergoing an educational transition that implies significant changes in learning and teaching methodologies, in compliance with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Within this phase, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) provides the opportunity to enhance student performance and improve academic assessment. An experimental procedure has been implemented within the Coastal Engineering course (Sea Sciences Faculty) to decrease academic failure (to date, 25% of no-show and 35% of fails), and to allow students to achieve better grades. During the last academic year, students were encouraged to follow a new learning plan based on coursework performance, the duration of which was similar to the theoretical lessons, i.e., two hours a week. Assignments were not mandatory, and they only represented 10% of the final mark. Weekly homework was directly related to the main aspects of the theoretical lessons, and included practical exercises as well as research of particular cases about the topics explained in class. Hence, in addition to improving students' knowledge of the subject by encouraging them through the possibility of increasing their final grades, this method also supports the application of cross competencies that allow students to:
   a) check their learning progress;
   b) introduce them to e-learning;
   c) learn complementary concepts of scientific research by using e-databases;
   d) refresh and update the theoretical concepts provided during the live lectures;
   e) add new teaching material to enhance the comprehension and study of the subject;
   f) think for themselves by becoming autonomous when the course is over.
   Despite representing only a low percentage of the final mark, a complete dedication of the students was achieved. This experience resulted in 97.4% of the students successfully passing the final exam, thus achieving better grades.

AB Varazdin County, one of the twenty counties in Croatia, places a great emphasis on educational strategy. According to the law, in Croatia the counties are authorized to control the network of primary and secondary schools. This is why Varazdin County has found partners for its development in 33 primary and 14 secondary schools with around 20 000 students altogether. The county has started the project of the Centers of Excellence, which work on detecting and including the most prominent students from different schools. The goal is to create a county that is prominent for its technological advances, innovations and places a great emphasis on education and knowledge.
   This unique project was started in 2007 and it develops continually. The Centers of Excellence are aimed at students with special talents, students who are successful and are eager to expand their knowledge. Every Saturday they come to Varazdin, the County's capital, where they do additional work guided and mentored by the top teachers. The project is logistically well organized, so the students have free transport and meal. Basically, everything is aimed at the student and the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge. The first Centers of Excellence were organized for Maths, Physics and ICT because in Croatia the number of students who decide to study these subjects at universities is continually decreasing. In more developed countries, the skills acquired by learning these subjects are among the most important factors of development. In the past, Maths and Physics served as the basis for the development of technical, technological, biological, medical and other sciences, and combined with ICT their importance is even greater.
   Due to the growing interest, the County's Department of Education has started new centers which have been given all the necessary logistical and financial support. During the school year that ended in June, there were 9 Centers of Excellence altogether (besides Maths, Physics and ICT, there were also Centers for Entrepreneurship, Chemistry and Croatian, as well as the last three organized Biology, Communications and New Technologies). Due to the growing interest of the students, some Centers have introduced entrance exams, which serve as a guarantee that the students will be able to keep up with the demanding programme for the talented ones. There are some 800 students in the system at the moment (top 4%), who are guided by around 100 mentors, all of which are the County's top experts.
   This unique project is supported and acknowledged by the community and the Croatian Ministry of Education, but it is entirely financed from Varazdin County's budget. The costs for this year are around 300 000 (sic), which is approximately 1% of the County's overall budget. This is only one among the many County's projects that are aimed at education (54% of the budget is directed at education).
   The value and importance of the project is best represented by the fact that Varazdin County has 27 state champions in different subjects and disciplines from primary and secondary schools, 28 vice champions and 24 students who were placed third. This is the results of the work of the Centers of Excellence as well as other projects in education, such as building gyms or expanding schools. Varazdin County is the only county in Croatia where the majority of the students (87%) attend classes only in the morning.

DE ICT-based materials; interactive presentations; applets; videos
AB Subjects like statistics typically require greater mental effort than other subjects. Mere attendance is often not enough. Teachers are aware of this and will, in many cases, try to help students. We have designed different types of ICT-based materials to help students in various ways. We offer interactive presentations on PowerPoint, applets with the free software GeoGebra, and videos of how to use the Excel spreadsheet. Each material serves its own purpose.
   Interactive presentations can provide step-by-step explanations of theoretical and practical statistical issues. Throughout the presentations we have display breaks so that students can control the pace according to their level of assimilation. Highly graphical sequential explanations avoid excessive text reading and guide students' attention through proper reasoning. There are also test questions for students to check how well they are understanding. The student clicks on one of the options offered and automatically gets a response. If correct, a sequential explanation of the solution appears and if incorrect, the user must choose another option.
   GeoGebra applets allow students to gain practical experience with different statistical tools. They can find answers to what-if questions and, therefore, improve their understanding of concepts which they sometimes find highly abstract.
   Finally we have made videos on how to use the Excel spreadsheet in order to help students with basic issues, but ones which can prove an obstacle in practical classes. The videos allow teachers and students to devote class time to statistical rather than computational aspects.
   The evaluation of the experiment carried out in the 2013-2014 course with these materials has been satisfactory, both in terms of the assessment made by the students and the frequency of use thereof. In an on-line survey, about 85% of students stated that they used some of the materials and the average rating was over 3.5 (on a scale of 1-5) for the three types of materials.

DE Stripping Voltammetry; ICT; Laboratory; Teaching Innovation
AB The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the classroom has shown a great improvement in student learning and a significant and positive impact on student achievement.
   ICT is normally employed in theoretical lessons for the assimilation of the concepts. However, in Analytical Chemistry laboratory classes can also be very useful, especially when complicated concepts of difficult comprehension are encountered. Thus, this type of material can be an alternative to improve student attendance and concentration in the laboratory, not only in the classroom.
   It is noteworthy to mention that Stripping Voltammetry, as other parts of Electroanalytical Chemistry, involves new and abstract concepts for the students which attend demotivated to the laboratory. Because of that, several interactive teaching materials have been created for the practical session based on "Anodic Stripping Voltammetry".
   In these interactive activities, the basic principles of Anodic Stripping Voltammetry and each step of the voltammetric process are described using simulated animations.
   A survey to evaluate the quality of the teaching material from the student point of view was carried out with different groups of students. In general, excellent results were obtained indicating the enormous acceptance of the students for this type of activities no matter their level and degree.

AB Technology has impacted all fields of society: sciences, media, and social interactions, and above all education. The emergence of Information and Communication Technologies has brought both opportunities and challenges for teachers and educational institutions at all levels. In the field of foreign language education, the influence of cutting-edge technology appears to be more crucial; a myriad of models, trends and applications seem to provide opportunities to enhance the quality and accessibility of language learning for everyone. One of those models is blended learning (BL). Graham (2003) claims that BL encourages: access to knowledge; social interaction; personal agency; cost effectiveness and ease of revision; pedagogy; increased access and flexibility; an increased cost and effectiveness. Another trend is the Flipped Classroom (FL). Tucker (2012) defines it as an instructional approach in which instruction occurs in advance and classroom time is maximized.
   Grounded in our praxis as tutors in a Blended program that uses flipped classroom in a higher institution in Colombia, here we report a case study on the challenges and strategies that teachers and learners recognized during two academic semesters. The program has faced challenges such as: technology, resources for design and implementation, attitudes of students, English teachers, and administrators towards the program, teachers' development, oral performance, interaction, and feedback.
   A review of the literature, and data collected from institutional evaluations, interviews and surveys illustrate how the program has created strategies and methodologies to achieve effective EFL learning regardless the setbacks. With regard to strategies, the findings reveal that the teachers and learners developed resourcefulness, adaptation to new environments and tools, optimization of available materials, a humanistic approach and diverse learning styles to succeed in the learning process. Finally, the main factors for students' success dealt with: self-regulation, self-efficacy, personalized tutoring and constant interaction with the tutor and classmates. There are still many challenges and heated debates on the effectiveness of blended learning programs but their usefulness and emergence is clear.

AB The traditional education system is based on well-known principles originating from the Ancient Greece. However, contemporary technology advances have directly influenced the evolution of learning methods, techniques and approaches. That is particularly true for information and communication technologies which almost equally challenge the traditional and new scientific fields. The introduction of new approaches, methods and strategies may raise the quality level of the entire educational process and guarantee the delivery of long lasting knowledge and skills that are applicable to real world problems solving. The newly developed sciences and professions are mostly interdisciplinary in nature and require the synergy of different knowledge, methods and skills. In order to provide adequate and quality support in all aspects of the educational process (teaching, research, tasks etc.) they must rely on the most effective of all known learning strategies. Although Software Engineering is today a matured discipline that develops knowledge and skills of engineering software, computer aided software engineering learning is a particularly challenging process. In order to define and offer a variety of means through which students may learn Software Engineering in this paper we have analyzed the application of several active learning strategies. The primary goal of performed analysis is to evaluate the novel approach and new strategies based on adequate techniques, tools and social skills in order to help students fulfilling the particular learning objectives established in Software Engineering and also to arm the teaching professionals with verified teaching methods and promising tools. Based on performed analysis we have derived certain conclusions, suggestions and ideas concerning pros and cons for each of applied active learning strategies.

DE Analysis; University of Cantabria; OCW; MOOC
AB A new stage in the Spanish university teaching began, with the Bologna Treaty signed in 1999, which aims to create a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Adapting to the changes proposed by the treaty led to the incorporation of the new Information and Communications Technology (ICT) into the university teaching field.
   Spanish universities have made an effort to adapt to the changes accompanying the Bologna Treaty, including the use of ICT. In this context, the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and the Open Course Ware (OCW) project are two of the main tools designed to share knowledge. According to the available data, the generation of MOOC and OCW courses places Spain among the countries with the highest contribution in the field of sharing information remotely worldwide.
   The University of Cantabria (UC), in its commitment to ICT, has developed programs such as Aula Virtual and UC Abierta websites, which gather platforms like Moodle, Blackboard, OCW, and MOOC. These Open Educational Resources (OERs) allow students to get virtual access to the contents of some subjects taught at UC, to use the additional documentation of subjects, or to satisfy their curiosity about subjects of general purpose with freedom of time and location.
   This work aims to estimate the evolution of the ICTs at UC, and it presents an analysis of the OCW and MOOC courses offered from its initial development and also establishes a comparison with other Spanish institutions in which these OERs also are available.
   Since 2007, the UC has shared a total of 175 OCW courses; on the other hand, in a period of 2 years 28 MOOC courses have been broadcast. This means that, in both cases, the UC is one of the ten most active universities in the ranking of the Spanish institutions.
   Moreover, after analyzing the data, it has been found that only 15 of the 50 studied Spanish institutions have consolidated some of their MOOC courses. In that sense, the UC is one among the five that have consolidated more MOOC courses. Additionally, the institutions offering both types of courses have been checked, finding that both types of courses are offered in 25 institutions, being the UC one of them.
   Focusing on data from UC and according to the classification proposed by the Bologna Treaty, it has been found that the percentage of OCW courses sorted by knowledge area, are linked directly to the graduate studies taught at the UC. In campus bases teaching as well as online teaching the Engineering and Architecture area has the highest percentage of courses, whereas the Arts and Humanities area shows the lowest percentage.
   According to the data, a different classification is found in MOOC courses, being Social Sciences area the most active one, and Science and Technology the least active. Interestingly, at the UC the areas with a higher number of courses offered are not the same in OCW and MOOC courses. In this study a certain complementarity between OCW and MOOC can be observed, and both types of open learning are used to meet the learner and teacher's needs.
   Finally, we can conclude that according to the available data taken from platforms such as Universia, MIRIADA X, Open Education Europa, Tutellus, and the website of each institution, the UC is one of the most active universities using ICTs in Spain, making therefore a valuable contribution to generalizing the use of ICT's in the teaching-learning process.

ID MOODLE QUESTIONNAIRES; GENERAL-CHEMISTRY
AB E-tools based upon Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are prevailing asynchronic activities within the Bachelor Curricula at European Universities as per the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) guidelines. The aim of this communication is to evaluate the role of Moodle questionnaires as an active asynchronous ICT platform to promote students self-learning and acquisition of procedural competences in the chemistry laboratory along with lab security rules and norms. This is to be applied to a course of General Chemistry of a heterogeneous group of first year students in the Agriculture Engineering Bachelor at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), Spain.
   The actual applicability of e-questionnaires is explored in three different scenarios: i) evaluation of the prior knowledge of students in concepts related to the lab exercises, sometimes already discussed in synchronous activities in the class (pre-lab evaluation), ii) helping students in understanding new principles or reactions before execution of the practical tasks in the lab (pre-lab evaluation); iii) following and rating the degree of competence acquisition after undertaking the lab course (formative and post-lab assessment).
   The project involves a first step of generation of a pool of questions and answers (including feedback) in the format of multiple options for every individual lab exercise with a single correct answer. This is followed by the e-questionnaire generation, which is posted in the Moodle platform at UIB and open for answer within a given timeframe (typically 2-3 days), whereupon the marks and correct answers will be delivered.
   We do also investigate how attractive self-prepared images and videos are in terms of identification of appropriate unit operations in the lab and avoidance of prevailing lab misconcepts. We do also present results on how Moodle questionnaires are rated by the students themselves (via hardcopy surveys) as compared to other asynchronous or synchronous models of teaching & learning competences in the chemistry lab curriculum before starting lab work including: i) reading of the laboratory scripts, ii) teacher explanation of the lab exercises, iii) students' self-writing of the script on the basis of the exercise aims, iv) collaborative learning in groups followed by presentation of the aims and the script summary to the remainder of students and v) minimal pre-lab tasks and acquisition of overall theoretical knowledge from experimental results. We finally propose measures to solve potential cons identified in using Moodle questionnaires allied to undergraduate chemistry lab task learning.

AB The educational research performed, is a strategy of educational innovation developed by several Professors of the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II of the University of Granada. With this strategy we tried "to move the classroom" to a different environment that offers multitude of multimedia resources, trying to enrich and improve the learning process and facilitating the acquisition of competences. This strategy consists of facilitating the study and learning of the nervous system functions, a system with a high degree of functional and structural complexity, by means of the use of multimedia resources, taking advantage of the itinerant exhibition "Brain: trip to the inside" performed at the Sciences Park of Granada. The students taking part in this experience, have answered in an anonymous way several questions related to the acquisition of knowledge and to the learning process before and after this experience was performed, which has allowed us to study and to compare the degree of assimilation and the acquisition of knowledge, and the improvement for the teaching that the workshops of the exhibition offers. To be able to confirm the above mentioned progress, evaluations have been realized to the students, before and after the experience. The results of the evaluations confirm the initial hypotheses, of which this educational strategy allows to improve the acquisition of knowledge, propitiating the performance of collaborative activities between the students, promoting the curiosity, the self-learning and facilitating the convergence to the European Higher Education Space.

DE Education; Information and Communication Technology; significant
   learning; methodology; historical archives
AB Much has been said about the use of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education. Needless to say, these have facilitated the way as the subjects are taught in our schools, but it is necessary to take a step further and allow that it's use help transform education. This means reconsidering some aspects of educational programs and methodologies, as well as giving up thinking of ICT as mere instruments which facilitate our teaching task.
   This research aims to analyse the combined use of ICT and the Archival as methodology to elaborate teaching unit contents, and its contribution to the development of significant learning and critical thinking in students. Although the research has been made for the case of a teaching unit content of the subject of History of Spain in the second year of High School in the Basque Country, it is important to highlight that the technique of combining the previously mentioned resources -namely, ICT, primary and secondary sources-, is applicable to other teaching units of History, as well as those of the remaining Social and Human Sciences. Therefore, ICT become an invaluable tool in this process of developing significant learning.
   Nevertheless, some researchers claim that the constructivist learning limits progress in acquiring knowledge, because only advanced students would be able to acquire new knowledge to the detriment of those students lacking conceptual knowledge. In this regard, it is important to note that the teacher can not fully detach the process of teaching in that primary sources provide students, or digital tools, as if it were a history lab or such, or university students, but by giving them the tools needed by a script, the background needed (scaffolding) and an equal partnership. Consequently, some of the aspects that will be investigated in this research are the following:
   a) the potential use of ICT to transform educational programs and methodologies, toward significant learning processes. This research will show objective tools as moodle platform, copies of written historical documents and graphics, as well as videos and in-depth interviews with experts in the field;
   b) the consequence alteration of the traditional development of the History class in order to supply students with the necessary resources, archival sources, and computing resources;
   c) and, because the main purpose of the proposed methodology is to develop active learning, a continuous, formative and multi-agent evaluation process is required. This will consist of three different parts: self-assessment (carried out by the student), co-evaluation, and the so-called 'process evaluation' (carried out by the teacher).
   The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a methodology that integrates the use of ICT and other resources, to achieve a transformation of the way we teach students to develop active learning, and so they can be competent men and women in the future, and to look critically at a world of diverse and disparate information.

AB In recent years university education experienced a deep transformation, which has resulted in a change in the role of teacher and therefore the methodologies used. These changes include (among others) the implementation of ICT in all fields of the teaching/learning process. So teachers should integrate into our practice creative and innovative strategies, including ICT.
   Experimental learning becomes very important when teaching physics, because this methodology allows students to apply theoretical concepts and to see their practical application.
   We have introduced virtual practices in the subject of physics of the first course in degrees of life and health sciences field. We have analyzed advantages and disadvantages of this methodology as well as perception of students.
   We asked students for which kind of practices (virtual or traditional) they found more stimulating and which have helped them to better understand the concepts studied in explanatory classes, since these are two of the main objectives to be achieved with this teaching methodology.

AB Currently, the problem of the formation of natural scientific concepts of schoolchildren occupies one of the central places in the system of education in Russia. Understanding the principles of consistency and continuity in the study of natural phenomena, creating a modern picture of the world in terms of scientific paradigms change, can effectively generate scientific, creative outlook. Knowledge of the nature's laws, an understanding of the fundamental unity of the inanimate and wildlife nature as well as of the social processes objectively encourage to take them into account in all areas of human activity, especially at the formation of environmental awareness of the younger generation.
   With the development of information society, the information and communication technologies have become an essential tool for an effective learning process in the field of natural sciences. New conditions for the development of Russian education, increasing demands of employers and higher education institutions to the level of knowledge and practical skills of schoolchildren as well as the increasing volume of information are circumstances which stimulate the introduction and improvement of the information and communication technologies and the emergence of various federal and local programs of informatization of the education system as well. Thus, within the Concept of modernization of Russian education and the project "Computerization of Education System" the Government of the Russian Federation has adopted a number of resolutions aimed at introducing the information and communication technologies into educational activities. The main idea of the project "Informatization of Education System" is the creation of conditions for the system implementation and active use of the information and communication technologies in the work of secondary schools.
   The article discusses the Russian experience of the use of the information and communication technologies in Tver Secondary School no. 45 with Advanced Studies of Natural Science. This work was performed in collaboration with Tver State Technical University within the framework of the general educational system. Sharing of the intellectual and material resources of the school and the university has enriched the education process with variety of new possibilities. The use of information and communication technologies is a successful example of the integration of science and education at the system "Secondary School - Technical University".

DE ICT in the Classroom; innovative learning; good practices in
   teaching-learning processes
AB In the recent years there has been, at European level, an increase in the implementation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Education, due to different strategies and policies implemented in several projects since the 80s.
   In the literature much has been debated about the potential of ICT and its applications in Education. It discusses and problematizes how ICT can help to extend or renew the traditional means of knowledge production bearing in mind that they allow access to multiple opportunities for interaction, mediation and expression, facilitated by flows of information and operational flexibility [1]; [2].
   The reality we see in primary and secondary schools leads us to realize that the ICT measures recommended by government in schools are not being fully implemented, at least effectively between students and teachers.
   In this way, the main proposal of this investigation is to draw a roadmap of the implementation/use of ICT in Primary and Secondary Schools in order to assess their use and thus design guidelines in order to find best practices of ICT use in teaching-learning processes. In particular, the study and design focus on the application of ICT in sciences teaching and learning.
   This paper will characterize some innovative good practices for using ICT in the classroom for Maths and ICT teaching programs we have found in our research and we can recommend to disseminate in other countries over the world.

AB Climate change is likely to define the global concern of the 21st century. This concern is a huge educational challenge which relates to the global aim of the educational network founded by Changing with the Climate project that is discussing, learning, engaging and committing students from secondary as well as primary schools to undertake actions for limiting the change in climate. As specific aspects and impacts of climate change are discussed in various academic disciplines such as: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography and Citizenship, the primary objective is to adopt a more holistic approach and link the teaching of all these issues from multidisciplinary perspectives. Thus, science may become more interesting and applicable to everyday life. This paper analyses the ICT challenges emerging from this type of approach.

DE teaching methodology; entrance examination; mathematics; schools;

AB This contribution looks at the relationship between the methodology applied in the teaching/learning process and university entrance test marks. The scope is limited to the two mathematics subjects taught in the last year of secondary school (mathematics II and mathematics applied to social sciences) and the University of the Basque Country. Individual marks, grouped by pupils and by schools, were subjected to statistical analysis, and an opinion survey was conducted in Basque Country schools in the 2009-2010 school year. The conclusions were these: The average university entrance examination mark improved in the period under study; entrance testing under LOGSE (the Spanish Act on the Educational System, repealed in 2006) reported poorer marks in mathematics II; marks were very low in mathematics applied to social sciences; and differences according to school type (public or private) were observed. The following general methodological characteristics were found in the opinion survey: textbooks of a certain publishing house prevail; self-produced materials are used more often in private schools; preparation for the examination is ongoing throughout the school year; a practical/traditional approach is used in mathematics II, while in mathematics applied to social sciences there is a wider blend of teaching styles. Two original conclusions are drawn that temper the general opinion that the last year of secondary school is entirely devoted to preparing for university entrance testing. Firstly, school programmes mainly target mathematical learning, and this target is linked to earning good marks. Secondly, although there are some differences between the two subjects, the schools that perform well in testing use a traditional methodology in which information and communication technologies are rarely used and research projects are practically unheard of. As a result of these conclusions, some questions about the methodologies used in secondary education are raised. These questions require further investigation.

AB Histology stands as a major discipline in the life science curricula, and the practice of teaching it is based on theoretical didactic strategies along with practical training. Traditionally, students achieve practical competence in this subject by learning optical microscopy. Today, students can use newer information and communication technologies in the study of digital microscopic images. A virtual microscopy program was recently introduced at Ghent University. Since little empirical evidence is available concerning the impact of virtual microscopy (VM) versus optical microscopy (OM) on the acquisition of histology knowledge, this study was set up in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences. A pretest-post test and cross-over design was adopted. In the first phase, the experiment yielded two groups in a total population of 199 students, Group 1 performing the practical sessions with OM versus Group 2 performing the same sessions with VM. In the second phase, the research subjects switched conditions. The prior knowledge level of all research subjects was assessed with a pretest. Knowledge acquisition was measured with a post test after each phase (T1 and T2). Analysis of covariance was carried out to study the differential gain in knowledge at T1 and T2, considering the possible differences in prior knowledge at the start of the study. The results pointed to non-significant differences at T1 and at T2. This supports the assumption that the acquisition of the histology knowledge is independent of the microscopy representation mode (VM versus OM) of the learning material. The conclusion that VM is equivalent to OM offers new directions in view of ongoing innovations in medical education technology. Anat Sci Educ 6: 307-315. (c) 2013 American Association of Anatomists.

AB This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a proprietary software program on students' conceptual and visual understanding of dimensional analysis. The participants in the study were high school general chemistry students enrolled in two public schools with different demographics (School A and School B) in the Chattanooga, Tennessee, metropolitan area. Using a "treatment group" and a "control group" (no treatment), a mixed-methods design was used in the data collection and analysis to provide a holistic view of the impact of the software on student learning. The resulting qualitative and quantitative data confirmed that the software enhanced the treatment groups' conceptual and visual understanding of dimensional analysis. In fact, when all of the quantitative and qualitative data were viewed as a whole, the advantages of integrating use of the software into the general chemistry classroom proved to have significant impact on student conceptual and visual understanding of dimensional analysis. The enhanced conceptual understanding was verified by quantitative data, which indicated a significant difference between the overall pretest and posttest scores of the treatment group (n = 14, t = -2.896, p = 0.008). On the basis of the descriptive statistics, it is evident that all students benefited from using the software. The qualitative data showed that students' visual understanding was enhanced and that they valued their experiences using the software and were able to enhance their knowledge of all aspects of dimensional analysis. The researcher takes the lessons learned from this study and provides practical best practices on effectively integrating elements of the software to enhance conceptual and visual understanding in traditional chemistry classrooms.

AB Background: Health science education faces numerous challenges: assimilation of knowledge, management of increasing numbers of learners or changes in educational models and methodologies. With the emergence of e-learning, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and Internet to improve teaching and learning in health science training institutions has become a crucial issue for low and middle income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa. In this perspective, the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (FMBS) of Yaounde has played a pioneering role in Cameroon in making significant efforts to improve students' and lecturers' access to computers and to Internet on its campus.
   The objective is to investigate how computer literacy and the perception towards e-learning and its potential could contribute to the learning and teaching process within the FMBS academic community.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among students, residents and lecturers. The data was gathered through a written questionnaire distributed at FMBS campus and analysed with routine statistical software.
   Results: 307 participants answered the questionnaire: 218 students, 57 residents and 32 lecturers. Results show that most students, residents and lecturers have access to computers and Internet, although students' access is mainly at home for computers and at cyber cafes for Internet. Most of the participants have a fairly good mastery of ICT. However, some basic rules of good practices concerning the use of ICT in the health domain were still not well known. Google is the most frequently used engine to retrieve health literature for all participants; only 7% of students and 16% of residents have heard about Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).
   The potential of e-learning in the improvement of teaching and learning still remains insufficiently exploited. About two thirds of the students are not familiar with the concept of e-leaning. 84% of students and 58% of residents had never had access to e-learning resources. However, most of the participants perceive the potential of e-learning for learning and teaching, and are in favour of its development at the FMBS.
   Conclusion: The strong interest revealed by the study participants to adopt and follow-up the development of e-learning, opens new perspectives to a faculty like the FMBS, located in a country with limited resources. However, the success of its development will depend on different factors: the definition of an e-learning strategy, the implementation of concrete measures and the adoption of a more active and participative pedagogy.

AB The following research shows which use is given by teachers at La Laguna University to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The main aim of the study is evaluating how the university teachers use different ICT tools as well as finding out which influence may have that use over the teaching-learning processes. The research will undertake both issues according to the scientific knowledge field of the teachers (Law and Social sciences, Health science, Fine Arts and men science, Engineering and Architecture), gender, age and previous experience in ICT's use. For performing this research, an online questionnaire has been performed allowing us to find out the opinion of 206 university teachers which use the virtual classroom for teaching (49.03% women and 50.97% men) with an average age of 47.23 years old. This questionnaire belongs to a wider research, but the actual document deals with the 'ICTs use' dimension where the information is compiled according to: Online internet information search, online internet communication and interaction (email, forums, instant messaging, etc.), edition task's development (office automation packages, audio/video software, etc.), download of contents (music and films download, etc.), development of teaching activities (use of collaborative spaces, University's virtual campus access, etc.), web participation (personal website, blogs, social networks, etc.) (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB The article addresses a relatively new and complex problem in social sciences. The term smart development has been transferred from technological to social sciences several years ago. Researchers have been analysing the fragmented aspects of the problem, however, systemic research in the field is hard to find. A theoretically sound concept of smart development is yet to be created. In social sciences, the substance of smart is quite different and more complex, compared to technological sciences. This is due to the nature of social systems because it is widely acknowledged that biological and social systems are among the most complex ones. This is why the scientific analysis of smartness in social systems and the substance of smart development of social systems is an important and challenging scientific endeavour per se. Another aspect of the theoretical problem is the positioning of the smartness category in social sciences among other related categories, such as knowledge, knowing, innovativeness, and intelligence. Some researchers regard smart development as the integration of ICT into everyday life and state functions (Komninos, 2011; Bailey and Ngwenyama, 2011), while others highlight the importance of knowledge management (Garcia, 2007; Yigitcanlar, 2010). Still others emphasize the coherence of infrastructure with objectives, the importance of learning, innovation, and networks (Allwinkle and Cruickshank, 2011; Kuk and Janssen, 2011), or stress the importance of business systems being a critical element of any competitive economy (Whitley, 1992). The idea of smart specialization which has been proposed by a group of researchers back in 2008 has been spreading fast in practice and has successfully become a platform for economic and social development. However, we still see a lack of a more detailed scientific interpretation and conceptualization of this phenomenon. Not clearly understanding what those categories really mean, what criteria should be used in assessing the smartness in strategic documents, many costly mistakes are likely to be made.

AB The wide development of the information and communication technologies provides conditions for using various digital learning objects in education. In Chemistry learning and teaching computer simulations are used for increasing clearness in Chemistry lessons and for supporting experimental activities in laboratory work. For this analysis the topic of acid-base titration was chosen. The research sample included educational simulations of acid-base titration available free on the Internet. In total 35 educational simulations of acid-base titration were found and used for didactic analysis with following research questions: What can be learned from educational simulations of acid-base titration? and How can didactic analysis of different kinds of simulation help to teacher and learner? In the research results of didactic analysis of 35 examples of acid-base titration simulators are presented. Resulting from the analysis we find three different types of educational simulations of acid-base titration with a specific use in Chemistry lessons: (1) simulations of experiments; (2) generators of titration curves according to the user's choice; (3) presentations of one titration. The summary of all analysed simulations and proposals of their educational applications is available from the web site http://titrace.wz.cz.

AB Time has shown that technology has always had a significant influence on and role in education. The more advanced technology was the greater contribution it made to education. When we look back we can clearly see how great an influence film, radio and television have had on education. The second half of the twentieth century was marked by the results of the use of computers and information and communication technologies in education as well as by extensive research in this field. The intense development of e-learning educational technologies initiated the process of transferring contextual meaning through media. In the paper we will analyze and describe the condition of e-learning at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb, university teachers' competence necessary for this type of teaching, as well as the models and lifecycle of e-learning materials.

AB This paper plans on analyzing recent research studies concerning the impact of using ICT skills and tools for teachers. However, the main focus will be on the impact of implicating teachers from the rural areas in using these skills and tools. Another main focus of this paper will be to: examine the impact of implicating teachers from the rural area in different ICT projects; compare urban and rural results gathered from the teachers; analyses the impact of using ICT skills and tools for teachers from the rural area (utility, personal development, limits, needs etc.); compare the results with other studies on this topic (at a national and international level) etc. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that the, European Union is implementing lifelong strategies policies. to encourage the development of ICT skills for teachers. In this sense, we can make reference to different documents that underline various aims that have been developed at the European level in order to ensure correlation between Member States (Memorandum On Lifelong Learning, Council Resolutions etc.). Thus, all countries, including Romania is faced with the fact that it has to improve and develop effective teaching and learning methods and contexts for continuum of lifelong learning, including ICT - Based learning technologies. A recent evaluation report steered with the support of eTwinning project shows that teachers from the rural area are developing more and more ICT skills. The evaluation was conducted in the period October-December 2012, by a team of researchers from the TEHNE Romania (The Centre for Innovation in Education) and from the Institute of Education Sciences. The evidence from this partial evaluation report suggest that: 35,4% of the teachers surveyed from the rural area attended online course; 43,6% of the teachers investigated used the eTwinning portal for continuous professional development; after attending the eTwinning program, 75,2% of the teachers surveyed from the rural area are putting more accent on using ICT support tool in their teaching. Methods and techniques: analysis of documents - research studies, laws, regulations circumscribe / structured legal framework of training and education on this issue, as well as: theories, forms, case studies etc.; survey questionnaires (partial evaluation results from eTwining project and other research papers on the topic). Returning to the purpose of this paper posed at the beginning, the article plans on analyzing the impact of implicating teachers from the rural area in developing ICT skills, as well as identifying the level of ICT tools usage: competences reached, limits, needs, opportunities, personal development etc.

DE Learning behavior; e-learning; andragogic principles; ICT
AB The assumption underlying this paper is that online environments and, in particular, e-learning ones trigger changes in the learning patterns and behaviors of adults. Inherently, that challenges the principles, methods and techniques currently employed in adult teaching and learning in traditional settings. Hence, the aims of the article are three-fold. First, it will focus on delineating the basic concepts that is will use: traditional learning, e-learning, learning behavior, e-learning behavior, andragogy, andragogic principles. Second, it will focus on the basic andragogic principles employed in traditional learning contexts and on their relationship with adult learning behavior. Upon their identification a brief discussion will be undertaken in relation with the way adult learning and teaching occurs in Romania nowadays. The analysis will take into account the extent to which the aforementioned principles are observed, as well as their observable impact on adult learning behaviors. Third, the article will analyze the patterns of adult learning behavior that are likely to occur in e-learning contexts and the extent to which these require a review of the andragogic. principles for e-learning contexts. Thus, the method to be employed in the second part of the article will be based on comparison and contrast between traditional environments and methods of teaching and learning on one hand and online environments for learning. The reasons underlying this research endeavor are as follows. Learning defined in very simple terms refers to the permanent change that occurs in a person's behavior. What complicates the discussion is actually defining a learning behavior and relating this to adults and the way they learn and the environments that facilitate this. Consequently, the novelty of this article consists in inter-relating the concepts of learning behavior, andragogic principles and e-learning. Thus, based on its interdisciplinary approach and findings this article will make a contribution to the fields of andragogy, social sciences and information and communication technology.

AB The present article analyzes the impact of new technologies on the individual learning of the students from Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, specialization Pedagogy of Pre-Primary and Primary Education. We believe that within students' individual preparing, modern electronic information resources are a viable and even more efficient alternative to traditional information sources. Using quantitative research methods and considering students' working skills, the acceptance and interest in new technologies, which have their own advantages and limitations compared to traditional information sources, we aimed to identify our students' preferences with regard to accessing various sources of information in documenting and preparing for exams.
   This study was imposed by the heterogeneous structure of teams of students attending Pedagogy of Pre-Primary and Primary Education, undergraduate studies. The investigated population, consisting of students from all the three years of study, presented interest in terms of their relationing with new media resources and virtual environments in order to improve their training. Starting from the assumption that the students who were analyzed differ in terms of their ICT skills and willingness to shape, refine and implement these skills in their own training, we found the existence of well-defined preferred typologies regarding the selection of ways to access information that would clarify and supplement the current course materials or allow the development of essays, projects, essays, graduation papers. This research also provides, a feedback among academic staff regarding how to recommend bibliographical sources to students in different situations. This aspect enables improving and streamlining of individual study for a quality training.

ID TEACHING EFFECTIVENESS
AB Course and teaching evaluation questionnaires (CTEQs) have become standard practice in Australian universities to evaluate teaching and student experiences. National results have shown that ratings of disciplines in the physical sciences (Information Technology, Engineering and Science) generally perform poorly on the CTEQs compared to other disciplines. In this paper, a thematic analysis of the students' feedback was undertaken for units in physical science cluster that students experienced as needing critical attention. These units were delivered in semester 2, 2010 at Monash University. The analysis has revealed that the top three concerns for students across the physical science disciplines are lecturer presentation, lecture content and unit organization. These findings are consistent with those from over 35 years ago despite changes in student demographics, advances in learning theory and technological advances used in the delivery of course content.

AB Purpose - This study aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the innovation system and the learning processes involved in a very specific cultural field: the production of early music.
   Design/methodology/approach - A single case study of the generic value chain in the music production industry describes and analyses the process and the actors involved in editing a new early music collection resulting from the collaboration between a record company and a public research organization.
   Findings - There is a need for new knowledge in the various stages of performance and publication of a new recording. The early music sector is a knowledge-intensive, science-driven sector that can be characterized as a system because the interactions among actors substantially influence final products.
   Research limitations/implications - The single case study represents a specific sector within the music industry. However, its conclusions can be applied to other fields in the cultural heritage sector.
   Originality/value - The literature on innovation in the cultural field primarily focuses on the relationship between art and information and communication technology (ICT). This paper is novel in analysing a case where scientific knowledge is key to new product development, and suggesting that we need to take account of the interactions among cultural heritage entities, universities and other knowledge production organizations. It concludes that these organizations should be involved institutionally in other aspects of the innovation process.

DE online learning; gender equality; ICT
AB In line with its mandate to provide wider access to quality higher education, the UP Open University takes full advantage of the use of web-based technologies as tools for teaching and learning. It introduced online tutorials in the delivery of content in 2001 as means of providing academic support to its students. In recent years, the UPOU utilizes the modular object oriented dynamic learning environment (MOODLE) as its learning management system thus making teaching and learning at UPOU fully online. This paper examined the gender equality among students enrolled in the UP Open University online vis-a-vis the introduction of online learning. A five-year enrolment trend (2006-2011) was analyzed and presented in graphs to compare the enrolment of male and female students. Results showed that there is a steady increase in enrolment in most UPOU programs which could be attributed to the growing popularity of online learning and distance education among Filipino students. Data further showed that female enrolment is greater than its male counterparts in the fields of education, communication, health and management sciences. Males, on the other hand, dominate in if-related programs. This study concludes that whilst female constitutes greater share in the enrolment (63%), there is clear indication that online learning appeals to both genders. With the increasing literacy and access to web-based applications that are gender-neutral, online learning is expected to gain more recognition as an alternative mode of education in the years to come.

DE Health science; self-assessment e-learning; evaluation of innovative
   strategies; WebQuest
AB In Health Sciences area, scientific knowledge has always been closely related with the technical performance and, in our day, is an inherent part of the so called techno-scientific development. From the various possible activities to be performed within the teaching of science, many of them are not made with the desired intensity. As a result, students receive most contents through theoretical explanation by the professor and their knowledge is evaluated by solving numerical exercises. That is why the application of ICTs at university education, particularly in the evaluation process is an area to be developed specially in the field of Health Sciences.
   This study has two main objectives. First objective is to stand out the student difficulties observed in the daily use of common tools integrated in virtual sites namely "Campus virtual" (e.g. Sakai and Moodle). Second objective is focused on the design and implementation of WebQuest as innovative strategy for collaborative evaluation and self-assessment e-learning in the area of Nutrition and Food Science, as part of an innovative education project (UCM-2013-85). On this site there are structured and guided activities that provide students with a well-defined tasks and resources. The case of study was a workshop, about "Nutrition-labelling workshop", included in the subject of "Food Science", which is integrated into the Pharmacy Degree (second year). This subject enrolled a total of 115 students in the class, divided and grouped in "virtual groups" of maximum 5 students.
   Preliminary results showed that, despite the comprehensive management of youth regarding new technologies, most students are not totally comfortable with the use of these e-learning tools. In this case, most of the student (62.6%) submitted the e-portfolio with their critical review in the correct place indicated, but the rest of the students (43 of the 115 student) used other way (e-mail, personally given, etc) to deliver their work. In order to minimize the difficulties mentioned above, we propose to design and implement a WebQuest as innovative strategy for collaborative evaluation and self-assessment e-learning. In this site the student could find easily all the information and process details necessary to perform the task. Once designed, the main drawback in WebQuest implementation was the lack of restriction access to the workshop for any person outside the subject, because the restriction tools of the applications were not available for UCM mails, being impossible to limit the WebQuest use only to our students. In this way no supported materials could be attached in the proposed WebQuest and in any case the student evaluation could be included in this virtual site as we cannot provide enough privacy.

AB The essay presents the incorporation process in the reconstruction of distance education in Italy.
   The paper tries to highlight the transition from modern to postmodern society, focusing both on this extraordinary change in the landscape of cultural and communication processes, and outcomes for the education system and educational and pedagogical models that govern this relationship.
   The reasoning is linked in the space of intersection shared by developments in communication sciences, pedagogy and sociology of education. In fact, these disciplines are interested from the radical transformation that old and new media led in social and educational systems.
   The research aims to understand, on the one hand, the potential of these techno-social environments for educational systems, on the other, raises new questions for a sociological reflection more attentive to new social dynamics produced by these technologies.
   The reflection is primarily theoretical. We seek to trace, through these different disciplines, the effects triggered by the advent of ICT on persons and learning systems. Then, the search is accompanied by a reflection on data of secondary nature.
   We start from the idea that, despite widespread criticism, immobility of education systems, and the absence of an overview about the use of these new devices in teaching practices, we register a significant tendency towards change.
   On the basis of these considerations, the research attempts to:
   center dot define the framework of experiments and use of ICT within education systems (universities and schools);
   center dot highlight any differences in perspectives and models in use among the e-learning systems and teaching practices;
   center dot draw a reflection of risks and opportunities, strengths and weaknesses associated with the use of such instruments and techno-social environment in educational processes.

AB The higher education institutions (HEIs) of today are expected to educate professionals for the future working life, which requires both professional expertise on specific field and multiple other skills that are mostly related to the new processes of working. In the field of engineering sciences, for example, detailed knowledge on specific technique or technologic field needs to be combined with project management knowledge, social and communication skills, business intelligence and financial knowledge. Moreover, multidisciplinary knowledge from different fields, for example knowledge on information and communication technology (ICT) combined with expertise on health care is highly valued. In addition, the graduating students are expected to have experience on processes of working life and abilities to cope changes, stress and uncertainty. At the same time, the HEIs are encouraged to support their activities on external project funding.
   In order to find solutions to these challenges, the research, development and innovation (RDI) activities are integrated in practical teaching and learning in Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS). The RDI activities include research and development projects that are mainly implemented on external funding from various sources, e.g. European Union. The students' participation in the project activities is implemented e.g. by project courses that are integrated in the curricula of the degree programmes.
   Students' participation in the RDI activities forms a linkage between teaching and research: it connects these processes and contributes to the development of innovative learning environments in HEIs. Further, students' involvement in RDI promotes students' professional skills, innovative working methods and appliance of theoretical knowledge into practice. However, integration of RDI activities and teaching requires new tools both for the students and the teachers. For the students, participation in RDI integrated teaching calls for active attitude to learning, internal motivation and ability to apply theoretical knowledge into practice. From the teacher's perspective, the project courses challenge the traditional ideas of the course contents, teaching methods, learning outcomes, evaluation criteria and estimation of students' workload.
   In this paper, we discuss the challenges of integrating research to education in higher education level and present some methods for this. Based on our experiences on RDI integrated teaching in TUAS, we present the outcomes and discuss the future perspectives of teaching and learning.

ID SATISFACTION
AB A large scale expansion of learning is required to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. However, conventional face-to-face learning cannot address the massive learning needs that exist. The development of Internet and web technologies has made it possible to "reach the unreached" and facilitate learning among farmers, landless laborers and marginalized individuals, regardless of their literacy levels. Giving knowledge and information for farmers is an important approach to enhance productivity of agricultural industry. It can also help solve acute problems existing in rural areas and developing rural economy. Web-based education programs for farmers in rural areas can bring about such benefits as enrolling large numbers of learners, covering a wide variety of areas, reducing costs, transmitting and sharing quality learning resources, and increasing farmers' access to education. It is quite important for the country like Sri Lanka since the main income source of the rural sector depends on agriculture and farmers are facing difficulties to get knowledge and information for improving their productivity. Identifying this issue, the Institute for Agro-technology and Rural Sciences of the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka has implemented an Online Distance Education program called Online Agro-technology Diploma for farmers in Sri Lanka. Learning Management system was developed in local language using Moodle. Online discussion forums and chat sessions were also designed in this program in order to help farmers to make daily communication with their colleagues and teachers on issues in agriculture. The prototype was developed and implemented in 2009. Currently, about 500 farmers all around the country have joined in this course. In this study the main objective is to find out the effectiveness of web-based collaborative learning as a means for giving knowledge and information for farming community through investigating user satisfaction. This study conducted a survey to understand student farmer's attitudes toward web-based learning program. The questionnaire was distributed to 60 farmer students who already completed their Diploma and who are near to complete. The respondents were asked to answer questions related to web based learning experience as well as their perceptions on web based learning. With a 90% response rate, a total of 54 valid questionnaires were collected. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used to analyze data for this research. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to prove the significance of the variables. We used ten variables as independent variables, and user satisfaction as dependent variable. The results indicated that out of ten, six independent variables namely, proper assistance by online tutors and mentors, interactivity of learning activities and multimedia introduction, satisfaction with online discussion forums, language of instruction and language of Learning Management System, updated timely and relevant information and flexibility of course are the critical factors significantly affecting learners' perceived satisfaction. The results also show institutions how to improve user satisfaction of web-based leaning implementations and it provides insights for institutions to strengthen their web-based learning implementations for people who willing to acquire knowledge to improve their socio-economic status while involving in their profession like farmers.

DE ICT; farmer education; socio-economic status of farmers; information and
   knowledge gap; Sri Lanka
AB Agriculture is the mainstay of Sri Lankan rural sector which occupies 75% of total population. Farmers face constraints in gaining access to information and knowledge that could improve their livelihoods to maximize crop productivity. Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based farmer education serves as a means for effective transfer of knowledge, information and technology to farmers while being engaged in their cultivations and enabling them to apply the knowledge directly to improve their farming output. To bridge the existing knowledge and information gap for farmers, University of Colombo Institute for Agro-technology and Rural Sciences, Sri Lanka has built the e-learning program (Online Diploma in Agro-technology) for farming community in Sri Lanka both in local language and English, which is an ICT-based agricultural education system to improve productivity, income and socio-economic status by disseminating a fresh expert agricultural advice to farmers. Agricultural experts generate lessons based on relevant information and knowledge on all agricultural practices received in the form of text and digitally converted lessons developed on online Learning Management System in Moodle. In 2009, a prototype was implemented with 60 farmers all around the country. Participants were trained for on-line learning mode. Learner support was provided through online tutors. Quality was ensured according to quality standards developed by Commonwealth of Learning. This is the first-ever attempt by the university system of Sri Lanka in providing an opportunity for farming community to pursue further education with ICT to be competitive in the Knowledge-Economy. At present around 500 farmers are following the program.
   In this article, an analysis of registered farmers' who followed the course regarding corresponding effect of following of e-learning program is reported. Data were gathered on a pre-tested questionnaire, formal, informal discussions and participatory observations. Results were analyzed using statistical methods (Percentile and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test). The built system provided a platform for rural youth who are involving in agriculture to have access to meaningful education using alternate modes of delivery. Farmers are particularly interested in this as our operation is designed in local language without having any fixed learning times of the day. Through this it was possible to reach the people who have never dreamt of education through online modes. At the beginning of the course they had no competency with computer usage and ICT applications even some of them never had touched a computer before taking up the course. Therefore, it was a major challenge to train them for ICT. After an orientation on ICT and Internet usage it was possible to train them and ICT was rapidly accepted by farmers. Now they are able to use Internet without any difficulty, all of them have e-mail accounts. The analysis showed that about 80% of farmers have followed the e-learning program which increases yield, income, knowledge, skills and social status. There was a significant relationship existed between following the course with income and empowerment of the farmers. On an average 75% of the farmers studied with this course showed a good follow-up with positive impacts. ICT based education can be considered as a good method of giving information and knowledge for people who are not benefited from formal method of education such as farmers to improve their socio-economic status.

DE Innovation; practical learning; food industry
AB One of the main objectives of the chemical degree is to prepare professionals for the food industry, as well as future researchers and teachers in this field. To achieve these goals, it is required that students acquire scientific knowledge, but also training to use it well, to think, and to assume responsibilities in the world of food industries. Teaching and learning methods are changing considerably and it will continue being in response to social and technological advances [ 1]. Of course, conventional lectures with exercises will always exist, although with an increasing use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) [2]. Practical work in the laboratory and in pilot plants are usually required and demanded by the food industry to improve practical knowledge of the graduates. Other educational tools that are becoming important are the Problem Based Learning (PBL) approach and the development of projects prepared by groups of students. However, this kind of practical teaching is only partial as industry and university do not collaborate as much as it should be. A closer relationship between industry people and university are essential for the implementation of modern training programs [3].
   The actions presented here are in the context of a global curriculum of the Chemistry degree at the University of Extremadura, Spain. It presents an analysis of a teaching innovation project, with the students of fourth-fifth level of chemistry conducted during the academic year 2012-13 in the matter Food Organic Chemistry. This activity included visits to several food industries closed to Badajoz (Spain). Professors, students and professionals from different food industries have worked together to help our students to improve several competences and skills such as team work, analysis of real industrial situations and communication skills. Moreover, this project includes a new form of teaching the basics operations in food engineering. The students were motivated to develop the forgoing competences and to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the teaching/learning process. The main objective of this experience was to facilitate the students to make the bridge from the theoretical concepts to their application to the food industry reality.

DE Cooperative Learning; ICTs; blended learning; learning together
AB The traditional teaching methods in Higher Education Institutions mainly centered in teachers as the only responsible of learning have begun to shift to a new approach focused on encouraging learners to discuss, debate and ultimately develop their critical thinking through a student-centered scenario. Cooperative learning (CL) has been recognized by teachers as a convenient technique which brings the opportunity to develop high-order thinking skills in learners through their organization in small groups where they learn on their own, without the constant and direct teacher supervision. Collaboration between students provides countless benefits including increase of their learning achievement, social skills, conflict resolution and making decisions, which are essential skills in the current real-life tasks. Learners also experienced positive interdependence because all members' effort is required for each group in order to achieve succeed for the team, as well as individual accountability is also present due to that individual contributions are also necessary during the process. Since interaction between learners is essential for effective knowledge acquisition, a flexible learning environment, therefore, is required. In this sense, the advent of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has contributed to create powerful computer-based collaborative learning environments, facilitating communication and collaboration between students and, additionally, providing tutors the media to support, monitor and guide learning in a synchronous or asynchronous mode.
   The present article examines the effectiveness of the implementation of several cooperative learning strategies with first-year undergraduates through the employment of different ICT tools supported by in-class teaching within a blended learning scenario. The study covered different students' profiles and showed a significant improvement in achievement rates and positive changes in student attitudes for all courses evaluated, including large-enrollment classes. In addition, students considered positively the method employed according to the learners' perceptions found in questionnaires handed in at the end of the experience.

DE Conductivity sensors; chemical laboratory; laboratory practice
AB Sophisticated data collection and analysis instruments are subject to UNESCO standards about competition in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). It was found that students using data collection systems in their experiments, among others:
   - Invest more time talking about what is happening, and speculating about what will probably happen.
   - Develop skills to interpret graphs in a meaningful context.
   - Evaluate information and develop their knowledge of science.
   - Acquire skills in handling data; calculate medians and totals, create plots, diagrams and drawings.
   In our laboratory we have used computer-aided experimental techniques (CAET) to verify the advantages provided by these techniques to chemistry learning. The laboratory practice selected for this purpose was "Conductivity titration of acetylsalicylic acid in aspirin" included in the third year of the Chemistry Degree in the Jaume I University.
   The basic components of the CAET have been the software DataStudio, a conductivity sensor for data collection and a "USB-Link" adapter as interface connection, all of them manufactured by PASCO and commercialized in Spain by PRODEL.
   To evaluate the work progress and check if the objectives were achieved, we asked the students' opinions, which led us to the following conclusions:
   - The learning process is enhanced ("we know what we are doing in the laboratory and if we are doing it well. The vast majority of the time, we do not know what we are doing until we get home.").
   - It is easy to use and facilitates the work. (We write down the calculations and do the graphs directly on the computer so the work we have to complete at home is reduced")
   We can conclude that CAET help to achieve a better understanding of chemical concepts. They are not difficult to use and they are in line with the traditional methodology, since they still use the classic experimental devices.

DE digital literacy; enactive representation; symbolic representation;
   interactive digital storytelling
AB Nowadays it can be argued that Information and Communication Technologies are widely used at all levels of education. In the Greek educational system the ICT implementation starts from the early childhood, as proposed by the New Curriculum of the Greek Ministry of Education, named: "Digital School".
   As Marc Prensky(2001) has claimed, today's children are thought to be "digital natives", as they were born and keep growing up, in a society where the digital media hold a significant and increasing role. In this paper, our purpose is to present an educational intervention that aimed to approach a learning method in the field of the use of ICT inside the classroom. This approach was planned on the notion that children would be activated effectively in a process in which the acquisition of the new knowledge would be the result of an active cooperative construction.
   This intervention was carried out as part of the thesis research conducted for the Postgraduate Program entitled : "ICT for Education", of the University of Athens. It refers to the teaching of natural sciences and specifically to the phenomena of the melting and freezing of matter, through educational activities of experiential learning. More specifically we adopted the enactive (sensori-motor) and the symbolic representation of knowledge, as suggested by Jerome Bruner (1966).
   The intervention took place in a kindergarten class and thirteen children-seven boys and six girls-at the age of six, participated. During the project the children formed two separate groups. The first conducted real time experiments on the melting and the freezing of common materials, while the second one approached the same phenomena through appropriately designed educational software.

DE Physiotherapy; ICTs; multimedia; learning; innovation
ID WEBQUESTS
AB The present project is a proposal to design and develop multimedia materials to be implemented in the new educational degree in Physiotherapy (Universitat de Valencia, Spain). These materials have been developed from a multidisciplinary perspective in the field of Health Sciences. Different departments of this field such as Physiotherapy, Nursing, Social Psychology, and Physical Education have contributed to design and develop this innovative project. Today, it's widely known that information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the European Network of Health Sciences in Higher Education have become and acquired a relevant role for professional, social and educational objectives.
   The origin of this project takes place in the web 2.0 that has been already used successfully as an educational tool in the subject (ICTs) in the degree of Physiotherapy. From this previous experience, we have tried to implement the contents to achieve two specific or main objectives:
   1) Firstly, we have developed these new digital resources to complement and adapted them to the different subjects.
   2) On the other hand, in this project we have take into account the existing resources and adapt them to the new technology. The materials developed for the different subjects are the following:
   Psychology of Disability. In this subject we have developed a specific glossary of terms and basic concepts of Psychology using podcasts.
   Biomechanics and Applied Physics. In this subject, we have elaborated an interactive auto evaluation questionnaire to enable the students to consolidate the acquired knowledge.
   Kinesitherapy. We have used some videos following a logical structure to allow the physiotherapist to develop and even evaluate chronologically their work taking into account the difficulties of the exercises.
   Hydrotherapy. For this discipline, we have also designed some video recordings so as to show different approaches
   General Pathology. In this subject, an interactive questionnaire has been adapted, using audio visual resources to evaluate the basic concepts of the subject.
   Physiotherapy in the Respiratory System. Related to this subject, we have designed an interactive webquest, where students can get their first experience with this subject.
   First Aid Techniques for Physiotherapy. Some audio-visual recording materials have been developed to show the adequate techniques learned during the academic year.
   The results obtained have provided us enough useful information to design a blog to gather information from the different courses mentioned above so as to carry out different interactive activities.

AB The Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) initiative has experienced a considerable expansion and it is being integrated into curricula all across Europe. Although this teaching approach has been mainly practiced in primary or secondary levels, it is currently being displaced to Higher Education. The number of English-taught programmes at tertiary level has tripled since 2002. However, they still stand far beyond the studies conducted in earlier educational stages, and further empirical research still needs to be developed in order to have a reliable overview on the results of its implementation at universities. Furthermore, the use of ICT tools in bilingual classrooms is increasingly gaining strength to support the new challenge of facing instruction in a second language by bilingual lecturers. The present study evidences the usefulness of multimodal resources related to ICT tools for lecturers performing their instruction in a second language at the Chemistry laboratory.

DE Teaching and learning; information and communication
AB People working within modern education must be acquainted with modern information and communication technology (ICT), which is also rapidly evolving and may constitute a complex field of specialization by itself [1]. Many tools can be classified as ICT, and they are being constantly improved. Assimilation of new versions of already existing hardware and software besides newer and better apparatus to manage them may be difficult for teachers already accustomed to traditional ways of teaching. On the other hand, young students are targeted everyday with digital media information bringing new and more powerful but friendly user technology. Young people may be more knowledgeable on such technology and eager to use it for various purposes. The difference in frequency and ability to use digital media may produce a breach between generations affecting all levels of education. University teachers face a tremendous challenge since they need to keep themselves updated not only within their subjects of expertise but also with modern applications of efficient and modern digital technology [2]. Young students are not just more familiar with digital media but they also expect teachers to be equally able to use it for teaching purposes. All considered, modern ICT provides alternatives to improve learning and teaching for both teachers and students. It is very important that teachers know and acquire competence to use ICT in their various programs and designs, in order to make their lessons more instructive and easy to understand. Therefore, a group of teachers in the FES Zaragoza UNAM have worked since several years ago to build up such a competence within our fellow teachers from the Chemistry, Pharmacy and Biology (QFB) curricula. We have offered conferences and courses, explaining how to make better use of the internet and software available in the market, as well as interactive communication platforms such as Moodle. Our goal is to help our fellow teachers to achieve a deeper knowledge and to apply diverse strategies to reach their students with improved and easier to understand scholastic material.

DE ICT; Skill Education; Technology for Emerging Markets
AB India is in the midst of an unprecedented phase of demographic change. Nearly 63.38% (about 760 million) of India's 1.2 billion population is in the working age group (15-59 years of age). In 2010,90% (437.4 million) of India's total labour force was employed in the unorganized sector. However, only 5-10% of this workforce has received any kind of skill training. Therefore, we have an urgent need to exponentially increase the seating capacity of skill training institutes to reach government's target of 500 million skilled workers by 2022. To understand the problems faced by current skill training institutes in India, we conducted a survey and various face-to-face interviews with students, instructors and administrators at Government Industrial training institute, Sanathnagar, Hyderabad. From the data, we observed that among other reasons huge set-up cost (cost of tools, machines, raw material, etc.) of training workshops is the major reason which restricts the growth of such skill training Institutes.
   This paper looks towards embodied learning as a solution. Embodied learning in most simple terms is defined as using body for learning. It is a relatively new field which merges learning sciences and human computer interaction. It can be most effective form of learning in vocational training as the skills that are learnt are physical and involves body motion. We have combined research from multiple areas such as learning sciences, human computer interaction, simulations, and virtual reality to conceptualize our system. In recent past there have been significant innovations in the field of body motion sensors which can help us build such embodied learning environment with very low cost. We are using Microsoft kinect for body motion sensing. In our system we have created a virtual workshop environment which is similar to an actual skill training workshop. In the virtual environment the user can move around, pick up tools, and control a process just as he would do in real life. First the user has to follow a tutorial in which the avatar shows the user sequence of steps involved in doing the particular task, after this the user has to correctly replicate what the avatar was doing by using his own body. Application of such system ranges from learning wood working, machine operation to high end skills training like aviation, medical and combat. The system will be able to reduce the cost of skill training by 60-80% as the user will not require raw material, tools and machines for basic initial training.

AB Engineering education is by its very nature so focused on science and technology that there is an inbuilt tendency to turn our students into employees. The alternatives of becoming self employed or an entrepreneur seem to be ironed out of the curriculum.
   In 2006 the Karel de Grote-University College decided to redesign the curriculum of the engineering department. The goal was to introduce a minor in which students are introduced to topics such as financial management, marketing, operations management. In 2010 we evaluated the minor and concluded that it was still too much based on classical ex cathedra teaching. We continued down the path of collaborative problem-based learning and to further reduce the theoretical courses in favor of a more hands-on approach in line with the theory of effectuation. The redesigned minor is called "The Company".
   Its characteristics are:
   1. It is a continuous effort encompassing both the bachelor and the master level of their studies. Our first entrepreneurship program (2006-2010) made it clear that the development of competencies is a gradual process. Students need to exercise their creative and entrepreneurial talents time and time again. Therefore a continuous effort over many years is necessary.
   2. We aim at growth in specific competencies. Specifically we want to investigate the relation between innovation and entrepreneurship. This is done in collaboration with the Turku University of Applied Sciences, the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia and the Hochschule fur Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg in the INCODE project (www.incode-eu.eu)
   3. All students (freshmen to masters), coming from different technical fields (biochemistry, chemistry, civil engineering, mechanics, electronics-ICT, electrical engineering) regularly work together
   4. Collaborative problem-based learning is used throughout the four year program. Students build an e-portfolio of their work. This includes ideas for new products or services, drawings and sketches, pictures of prototypes, persona constructions, business plans etc.
   5. "The Company" is led by the master students. They get a (limited) introduction to management and they have to apply this in real time as managers of "The Company". The CEO, the director of projects and the director of communications are all students. We make a clear distinction between entrepreneurship education (years 1 to 3) and management education (year 4) [1].
   6. "The Company" is linked to outside companies that are innovative and have shown an interest in higher education and promote intrapreneurship. They provide continuous feedback and help us to develop the curriculum design.
   The Company also functions as a Research Hatchery within the context of the INCODE project. It is used as a testing ground for the Innovation Competence Barometer (ICB).

AB Concepts in Formal Languages and Theory of Computation remain to be vague and complicated for students undergoing undergraduate computer sciences programmes. Moreover, the volume of learning content delivered as mere lectures in a course semester also causes disinterest among students studying these courses in tier-3 engineering institutions. Considering the present generation students and their learning characteristics, our traditional approaches towards teaching-learning have miserably failed. In this learning research study, a technology based virtual learning approach aimed at creating interest in learning courses like theory of computation is attempted. This work also incorporates extensive usage of proven educational theories.

AB Electrochemistry is a topic found to be difficult to learn due to its abstract concepts involving macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic representation levels. Previous studies showed that animation and simulation using information and communication technology (ICT) can help students to visualize and enhance their understanding in learning abstract chemistry topics. As a result, interactive multimedia module with pedagogical agent (IMMPA) named EC (electrochemistry) Lab was developed in order to assist students in the learning of Electrochemistry. A non-equivalent pretest and posttest control group design investigation was carried out in order to gauge the effectiveness of EC Lab on students' understanding of concepts in the learning of electrochemistry. A total of 127 form four students from two secondary schools were involved in the study. Each school has one treatment group and one control group taught by the same chemistry teacher. Pre and post achievement tests were given to evaluate students' understanding of electrochemistry concepts before and after the learning of electrochemistry. Our results showed that the intervention as designed in the study yield significant difference between control group and treatment group in the understanding of concepts in the learning of Electrochemistry.

AB The latest developments of information and communication technologies (ICT) and its large penetration in different sectors of our society pose new challenges and demands in the field of education. This special issue entitled "Designing Nordic technology-enhanced learning (TEL)", presents and discusses how researchers in the Nordic countries are currently framing and thinking about issues that are related to pedagogical design of learning spaces, digital literacies, educational professional development, design of tools engaging students in collaborative inquiry learning as well as design-oriented multimodal understandings of learning.
   The objective pursued with the special issue has been to reflect upon current problems that educational institutions, practitioners and TEL researchers are facing in the Nordic countries as regards the acknowledgment of young people's ICT practices within formal education. Such analytical work has led us to identify and elaborate on what we believe constitute forthcoming research challenges for learning and education in the Nordic countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The European Higher Education Area requires to update our educational approach from the system of lectures to other ones based on innovative teaching techniques and self-learning. This makes available a high number of educational resources, as those related to the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), which have an important role in the standards of Bologna. The need to use animals in the training of professionals in Veterinary is undeniable as well as to provide them with the appropriate level of welfare related to their status of living beings. However, taking account the University policy on animal protection and the objective of reducing the number of animals in the practices (European Convention for the Protection of Animals used for experimentation, teachers and other scientific purposes), ICT can be very useful in the area of Health Sciences, and particularly in Veterinary Sciences, to improve understanding of the theoretical part of the subjects. Over the past years, our team in the Veterinary School of the University Complutense of Madrid has been developed various ICT to complement the traditional teaching practices in various subjects. These projects have been based on electronic format as digital video discs (DVDs) that include images and commonly manipulations in a reduced number of animals that are found in centers of teaching, research and in factory farms. This material clearly shows and explains the most important physiological phenomena and management techniques in a real and integrated way. It has been done for laboratory animals (rat, mouse, rabbit) and medium-sized animals as dogs used for clinical practices. On the other hand, these kinds of methodologies have also been focused to give an audiovisual explanation about basic management of exotic animals (domestic and wild birds and reptilian). In this case, their access, study and handling is great difficult. Also, this electronic format is used to explain some reproductive techniques absolutely essential, as artificial insemination technique for researchers or from a productive point of view for the students. Thus, in the modern context of teaching this material based on the new audiovisual and communication technologies can guarantee the students access to more educational material, minimizing the number of animals used and with the necessary quality for a complete understanding of those procedures. The result is an interactive and accessible e-learning tool that can be listened or read. It is adapted to the graduate as well as the postgraduate students, for practical and theoretical sessions, and can be applied to different species of animals and in several subjects in the Bachelor of Veterinary and related sciences. An additional advantage is the use in any time and place since the audiovisual hardware is practically eternal. In conclusion, this project is a complementary tool that facilitates the training of students combining the new technologies and the possibility to learn some animal procedures in detail that otherwise would be impossible to examine.

AB Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays important role in education especially in developing nations like Nigeria, which needs to develop her citizens to live functionally in a globally competitive economy. ICT is increasingly becoming more widely spread throughout University education worldwide. This may probably be because of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO's) policy paper for Change and Development in Higher Education, which urges higher education institutions to make greater use of the advantages offered by the advancement of communication technology, to improve the provision and quality of their education. University students are at the centre of this technological innovation in education, hence their use for this study. This paper sought to assess the level of students' Information and Communication Technology Competencies for the adoption of e-learning in Nigerian Universities. Four research questions and two null hypotheses guided the study. The design of the study is descriptive survey. One hundred and sixty 300-level undergraduate students randomly selected from the faculties of Arts, Engineering and Biological Sciences constituted the sample. Data was collected using questionnaire, named Information and Communication Technology Competency Test (ICTCT). The data was analyzed using percentage, mean and standard deviation for the research questions and t-test statistics for the hypotheses. The result indicates that most of the Science and Technology-based undergraduates possess higher ICT competency than the Arts-based undergraduates. The result also showed that area of specialization is significant in ICT competence of students but gender was not significant. Implications of the findings were highlighted based on which it was recommended among others that free compulsory ICT programs should be mounted for undergraduates, especially those based in the arts disciplines.

AB The efficient use of the technological resources in the teaching activity has become a challenge which cannot be postponed for the teachers of all educative stages due to the influence it has on the improvement of the quality of education. The incorporation of the new digital tools to the teaching and learning processes favours the collegiate building of the knowledge and the development of interactive and enriching methodological approaches, which are of paramount relevance in university education. For that, since 2009, the University of Alicante is promoting technological and educative innovation groups integrated by teachers, administration staff and students, with the aim of developing and trying innovative processes which adjust to specific institutionally pre-established priorities. In this piece of work, we are presenting the experience of the TACE group (Technology Applied to Educative Sciences) whose participants have developed investigation-action research line, which has a positive impact on the studies within the Faculty of Education. The results, specially the increase of the academic level of achievement, the spread of the knowledge and the satisfaction of the students and the teachers, encourage the members of the group to go further with their research lines. As a whole, the experience is set up as a satisfactory strategy to improve the quality of the university education.

AB In the last years, the University teaching has set us to teachers a development process and change in our educational practices. We must find new and innovative alternatives to pass on knowledge to our students. In the age of new technologies and communication, a huge amount of material can be found on the Internet. The fundamental role of teachers is to use all these tools for the benefit of students' knowledge with a previous pre-selection and validation of the resources. Chemistry is present in different fields such as architecture, archaeology, biology, geology, etc. In some cases, professionals of these fields have a basic knowledge on chemistry. However, taking into account the work that they are going to develop in the future, they need to increase such knowledge. The University of the Basque Country offers two official postgraduate master's degrees such as the Master on Restoration and Integral Management of the Built Heritage and the Master on Environmental Pollution and Toxicology, in where graduates of the previously mentioned four areas of expertise are included. Therefore, both masters make up multidisciplinary groups of professionals from technical and experimental sciences expertise areas. In both master's degree curricula, different subjects dealing with medium-advance level chemistry concepts are included.
   Considering the previous academic year's experience, a lack of some basic-medium level knowledge in chemistry was detected. Most of these concepts are common for some of the subjects of both masters (e. g. steps of the analytical protocol), therefore a common forum to broadcast all these additional chemist resources can be found to increase their knowledge in chemistry. A good alternative can be the creation of a blog. This Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tool can be used as a support to the E-learning to establish new channels of communication between teachers and students. Specifically, the edublogs are those blogs used to support the teaching-learning process in an educational context. In this abstract we present the preliminary stage of an edublog creation to teach basic-medium concept to non-chemist, useful for their professional future. The experience of this ICT tool application was restricted to two (one from each master) subjects (Restoration and Preservation of Materials and Environmental Biogeochemistry). In this preliminary stage, a design of some WebQuests which are going to be included in the edublog as strategy of guided learning are going to be commented. This resource is an appropriate tool to design tasks for the students. Results derived from the WebQuests (research work reports) are going to be accessible in the edublog for all the students, together with additional material for their personal study. Moreover, taking into account that sometimes the students look up in a higher rate their profiles in social networking sites than educational resources in other websites, the RSS feed of the edublog is going to connect to the widely used Facebook social network. This fact will allow students to have direct actualizations of the new contributions on the edublog (1-2 hours) in their personal Facebook wall, without the necessity of a direct revision of them via the edublog website.

DE E-learning; cooperative work; technology-enhanced learning; tutoring
AB The development of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) makes necessary the adaptation of teaching to these ICTs, facilitating a relationship between instructors and the new generations of students. Such ICTs are useful tools that can be used to improve and encourage teaching as a complement of lectures. Our aim was to employ different and active on-line methodologies designed to encourage learning in biological sciences. To develop such experience in the classroom, we chose the Neurophysiology subject, which is currently taught by the Department of Physiology (Animal Physiology II) at the Biology Faculty in the Complutense University of Madrid. Thirty students have participated in this study. We proposed to the students three kinds of voluntary e-learning activities: thematic chats, a questions bank, and tutorage with the instructor. Thematic chats are spaces that were used as mates-tutoring (students can solve their doubts with the help of their classmates) promoting cooperative learning. Chats were also used as spaces to share extra material related with the subject (scientific articles, news, movies, ....) encouraging the development of on line debates. The generation of a glossary and a short-questions bank provides two on-line spaces suitable for student self-and co-assessment, and to motivate student's creativity and self-learning. The on line tutoring with the instructor is a consulting space with the instructor by chat (public) or e-mail (private). At the end of the course we have analyzed the participation of the students in all of these activities and the students' perception of this experience. Participation data could be used as an assessment tool to evaluate both, the involvement of the students in their learning process and their attitude. Students' perception, including motivation and difficulty, is an index of the students' acceptance of this methodology. The magnitude of participation in the on-line spaces was high (63.3%), being thematic chats the most popular tool. The 46.6% of the students participated in cooperative tutoring, and the 40% added complementary information. Few students (13.2%) participated in the creation of the questions bank, likely because the generation of questions is a difficult task for the students. Glossary was also unattractive and only 26.6% of students participated in this task. Private instructor's e-tutoring and traditional-tutoring were only used for the students to solve questions about seminars. Thus, students considered that e-tutoring by cooperative chat provides them all the information and help they needed. Students' perception of this methodology was positive and it was considered as encouraging (67%), useful (84%) and easy (76%). There was not a correlation between the participation or the motivation of the students in these on-line activities and the final score of the course. These results suggest that on-line resources benefit and help to all the students, and also offer them self-assessment tools. Moreover, on-line resources provide real-time information of the learning process to be used for the instructor as feedback to modify teaching and assessment activities. Thus, the implantation of this methodology renders in a greater motivation of the students, promoting self-and collaborative-learning.

AB In present scenario we are facing a time of information evolution, in the ever changing world our teachers and students requires the right information from the right sources today.
   The present world is changing rapidly and the field of education is experiencing these changes in particular as it applies to Media Services. The old days of an educational institution having an isolated audio-visual department are long gone! The growth in use of multimedia within the education sector has accelerated in recent years, and looks set for continued expansion in the future.
   Teachers primarily require access to learning resources, which can support concept development by learners in a variety of ways to meet individual learning needs. The development of multimedia technologies for learning offers new ways in which learning can take place in schools and the home. Enabling teachers to have access to multimedia learning resources, which support constructive concept development, allows the teacher to focus more on being a facilitator of learning while working with individual students. Extending the use of multimedia learning resources to the home represents an educational opportunity with the potential to improve student learning.
   The elements used in multimedia have all existed before. Multimedia simply combines these elements into a powerful new tool, especially in the hands of teachers and students. Interactive multimedia weaves five basic types of media into the learning environment: text, video, sound, graphics and animation. Since the mode of learning is interactive and not linear, a student or teacher can choose what to investigate next. For example, one does not start on the first page of a linear document and read to the end. Interactive multimedia learning mode is more like constructing a spider's web, with one idea linked to another, allowing choices in the learner's path.
   The multimedia technologies that have had the greatest impact in education are those that augment the existing curriculum, allowing both immediate enhancement and encouraging further curriculum development. For example, the WWW serves as a storehouse of information that individual learners can search for subject matter content that specifically fits their learning agendas.
   In the context of the present study, the concept of smart classrooms does not completely do away with the traditional method of teaching. Rather it seeks to club the use of technology with conventional methods of teaching. The resultant product is a harmonious blend of the modern and the traditional. For instance, the teacher while teaching a lesson on volcanoes will supplement the information given in books by showing a video of how a volcano erupts.
   Educomp smart class is one of the applications of the ICT. Educomp smart class is transforming the way teachers teach and students learn. Educomp smart class is a digital initiative pioneered and invented by Educomp. Smart class provides a very systematic way of learning through curriculum and well equipped computer classes.
   Educomp smart class also provides a large repository of 3D animated modules and videos mapped to school curriculum. Frame by frame, with engaging and instructionally sound animated set of visuals while retaining complete control on the pace of delivery. The curriculum reach unfolds from kindergarten to grade twelve covering subjects like Mathematics, Science, English, EVS, Social Studies, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Economics and Business Studies.
   The Educomp Smart Class programme has an overall positive impact on students more in terms of generating curiosity and grasping complex concepts rather than capturing attention, while it helps teachers in managing time.

AB A solution to improve the students' interest for science study assumes ICT tools introduction in the teaching process. The SOP HRD 61839 project "Looking Towards the Future - Professional Training of the Teaching Staff to Use Modern Digital Resources in Efficiently Teaching of Chemistry. e. Chemistry", financed from the European Social Fund aims to develop ICT skills for professors who teach chemistry and technology-related subjects in the K-12 system. Even if computer usage in the learning. teaching processes is very successful, putting it into practice is rare in Romania. The project included two training components: a five-day module for developing basic IT skills and an eleven-day module for applying the newly acquired skills in chemistry teaching. A set of educational pilot resources were developed and used intensively during the training sessions organized in all 41 counties and capital of Romania. Although the project has its own learning content management system suitable for on. line and off. line training activities, all sessions were face-to-face organized in order to offer a maximum tutorial support to participants. The digital resources are focused on main subjects from organic, inorganic, analytic, physical chemistry and electrochemistry, being presented to the target group by trainers from the University Politehnica of Bucharest and University Politehnica of Timisoara. Since July 2011 until May 2012 more than 2500 trainees completed the two training programs. e. Chemistry is supposed to bring together people who experience similar difficulties in their teaching activity and are eager for finding solutions to teach more, better and faster.

AB K-12 students are great candidates for e-learning, but for different reasons than adult learners. e-Learning works at the K-12 level if focus is on "how does technology enhance the learning process". This paper presents a conceptual framework and a structured set of work strategies applied in the development of educational resources within the e-learning project "Looking forward future e. Chemistry", a project dedicated to introducing ICT tools to the K-12 chemistry teaching staff in Romania. It represented a tremendous challenge for our team, by its scale, but mostly by its specificity. The paper also provides reflections on the efficacy of the design process that resulted in formation of the design principles applied within the framework of the project.

AB The European Higher Education Area has promoted depth changes in the Spanish Educational System mainly based on the students' learning and assessment methodologies. In this regard, continuous assessing and self-learning are presented as a key factor for a quality teaching-learning process. Nevertheless, the lack of resources to conduct this task and the high number of students in the lecture room can be presented as drawbacks to get this objective. Moreover, carrying out continuous assessment of students' learning supposes a big challenge for professors, who must create new activities to follow students' progress during the course. These activities must promote students participation and simultaneously facilitate continuous assessments by professors.
   In the last years, ICTs have been presented as a very useful tool to conduct and assess these learning activities mainly based on the use of on-line platforms such as the Virtual Campus. These platforms are usually employed by professors to upload materials and documents which are considered of interest for students. However, among the most powerful tools that can be found in these platforms, the use of discussion forums could be highlighted.
   In this work, the use of on-line discussion forum in the subject "Instrumental Techniques for Environmental Analysis", which is taught in the Degree of Environmental Sciences of the University of Cadiz, is presented.
   In particular, students were asked through the Virtual Campus for participating in a debate about a topic related to the subject that was selected by professors. The activity was performed twice in the semester with different topics. In all cases, students' participation in forums was required and the frequency and quality of their contributions was evaluated. As a consequence, students needed to continuously study the contents of the subject for participating in the forums as it was observed. Additionally, this activity was useful to make students writing in a scientific style, giving reasons for their arguments and opinions, and using specific vocabulary. It is worth mentioning the improvement in the students' marks in the second forum for discussion showing the progress in their self-learning.
   In conclusion, the application of forums has been a successful alternative for self-learning of students that had to express their opinion about different aspects of instrumental analysis in a scientific context. Moreover, it was a useful tool for continuous assessment to professors, who could follow the students' progress during the whole semester in a way that could not be afforded using classical methodologies, with all students, in the lecture room.

AB The wireless world continues to grow as engineers develop faster, more robust technologies to free us from wires for greater simplicity, convenience and efficiency. The Information Communication and Technology (ICT) revolution has led to data to be accessed on line or off line. Technology has made the world a global village where people communicate to each other effectively and efficiently regardless of their locations. It is clear that the communication landscape has changed and this change has infiltrated the school system being an open system. The fundamental influence in education today is rapid information communication Technology (ICT) development and what the learner needs to know to succeed in the use of digital content. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the extent to which ICT has been adopted for instructional delivery in Kenya, examine the factors affecting ICT integration in schools and analyse the global trend on ICT use in instructional delivery with an aim of developing learner centred ICT adoption framework for an effective digital content. Survey design was used for explaining or exploring the existing status of two or more variables at a given point in time. Simple random sampling and purposive sampling technique was used to select the schools and head teachers to be involved in the study. Primary data was collected by questionnaires. The data collected was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS V. 19) software. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics which involved the use of frequencies and percentages. ICTs are transforming schools and classrooms by bringing in new curricula based on real world problems, providing scaffolds and tools to enhance learning, giving students and teachers more opportunities for feedback and reflection. The ICT integration in schools improved effectiveness and efficiency, improved accountability, data base management and communication. The school principals' lack of technical knowledge, their interpretations of regulations according to his/her own will, and their lack of support pave a way for the given problems and issues. Every school in Kenya should integrate ICT use in its management and instructional functions to reap the full benefits of such integration. This will help bridge the digital divide in education through the use of Information technology (IT) as this is the key concern of the educationist in developing countries like Kenya.

AB Over the past few years, we have seen the advent of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) transforming our conventional understanding of education, more specifically teaching and learning practices. While the introduction of ICTs have brought to the fore many optimistic benefits, such as improved lecturer-student interactions, new models for designing creative and innovative curricula, it also has begun challenging our institutional models and the environment in which we function. This has prompted a reconceptualization of how we teach in an ODL context. Hence, Unisa as an institute has also sought to recontextualize itself within this transitioning environment. This has brought to the fore questions of the readiness of the academics to meet the transitions of this changing context. As part of the exercise to engage with this changing context, the College of Human Sciences engaged with a research survey to deduce the creative use of ICTs in teaching and learning practices within the college as well as its prospects and challenges. A total of 132 academics, with representation from all departments and schools within the college participated. This research paper highlights the types of ICTs currently being used in the college, the frequency of use, how it is used in teaching and learning practices, challenges encountered with its integration in teaching and learning, positive and negative contributions rising from such integration, and why certain academics opt not to use ICTs.

AB Today, influenced by development of global net and scientific-and-technological advance, pedagogy, as well as any other sciences, is changing being strongly drawn towards information-and-communication technologies as highly prospective modern teaching aids. The article is to analyze in what way the ICT development modifies the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) teaching under the present-day conditions. The full text of presentation will be illustrated with short videos with resource materials worked out by the authors especially for ESP distance course.
   The authors come to the conclusion that teachers' tasks at present are to intensify the process of mastering the foreign language through the application of state-of-the-art technologies, to facilitate each student's activity in the process of learning and provide opportunities for their academic independence and creativity. The use of modern teaching aids such as computer programs and Internet technologies as well as distance learning render aid in solving these tasks.

AB An Educational Innovation Project is being carried out at the University of Malaga in two subjects concurrently. One is the 4th year subject "Structural Determination" of the degree in Chemistry, and the other is the 2nd year subject "Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering" of the degree in Environmental Science. In this paper we present a comparison of the academic results obtained by the two different student populations once the teaching innovation has been implemented. Furthermore, these results are also compared respectively with the academic results obtained in each subject over the last 5 years without the teaching innovation.
   The number of students enrolled in the academic year 2011-12 was 33 in the subject Structural Determination and 73 in the subject Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering. The teaching innovations were mainly implemented using some of the tools available in the MOODLE platform, which is available at the University of Malaga to create learning communities online. These tools were used to encourage the autonomous learning of students using both individual and collaborative activities. The most important tools were:
   1) The Virtual Workshops for mathematical problem solving by the students that in brief consists of 4 stages: a) trying to solve, b) publication of the correct solution, c) peer review and evaluation, and finally d) autoevaluation [1].
   2) The Doubts Forum in which any student may ask the group about specific difficulties that could arise during the running of the virtual workshops.
   3) Quizzes built from a questions and answers database generated by the students and related to selected topics. These questions are previously subject to acceptance, criticism or peer rejection through a specific forum for each topic, denominated quizzes forum [2].
   4) Wikis and the Group Forums in which students organized in several small groups should prepare and submit a report on any of the topics proposed by the teacher.
   As it could be expected, the participation of the students in this learning methodology needs motivation. In this case, the incentive for the students consisted on the assignation to their participation in the aforementioned learning activities of a relative contribution of 25 % to the total marks of the subjects. The remaining 75% of the total mark is assigned to the exam that students take at the end of the term.

AB On another paper presented at this conference, we showed the objectives, methodology and academic results obtained in an Educational Innovation Project at the University of Malaga. The innovations were introduced in two subjects: "Structural Determination" of the degree in Chemistry, and "Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering" of the degree in Environmental Sciences. The results of the evaluation of this project are presented here.
   The assessment of the success of the teaching-learning experience has been conducted through an anonymous survey performed among the students once the academic year is close to the end. In the poll, the students have to grade from 1 to 5 their satisfaction regarding to different matters introduced in the learning methodology. The poll comprises two sections, the first accounts for the satisfaction of the students with the face-to-face instruction, while the second inquires about their satisfaction with the virtual tutoring tools and their impact over the teaching-learning method followed.
   The results regarding to the first section of the poll were quite similar for both subjects. The satisfaction of the students with the teaching aids, lectures, practical classes, tutorial and the procedure followed by the teachers in the assessment of the skills that the students acquired during the course is generally very high. Nevertheless, it is noticeable a significant difference between both subjects in relation to the satisfaction with the physical medium. In this case, the degree of satisfaction of the students of Structural Determination subject was significantly higher than that of the Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering. Perhaps, this difference is due to the number of students enrolled in each one of the two subjects, which in the latter case more than doubles the one in the Structural Determination.
   The results regarding to the second section of the poll indicate that the procedural changes introduced were well received by the students. A very high percentage of the students considered that the first stage in the virtual workshops (trying to solve) is useful for the learning process, whereas the usefulness of the third and fourth stages of this activity (peer review and evaluation, and autoevaluation) get a lower mark. The satisfaction of the students was also very high in the development of the questions and answers database for the quizzes and in the preparation of the reports assigned to each one of the workgroup. However, in this latter collaborative activity, students have preferred the traditional live personal interaction versus virtual meetings, as is evidenced by the low use of the wikis and the group forums that were available to them.

AB The article presents the results of a research run by the Institute of Education Sciences - Department of Educational Counselling and Management in 2011 on the integration of the ICT tools in the activity of the guidance counsellors from different schools around the country. The article starts with a short overview of the way the web 2.0 tools are used in guidance counselling in other countries and what expectations are set for these new tools. Then the data collected on the use of web 2.0 tools are presented and analysed against the role of the guidance counsellors in the school context. The research involved a number of practitioners in the field of career guidance in a training course with a pre- and post- self-assessment of their different ICT competences related to the guidance tasks. The aim was to identify how good are the counsellors in assessing and improving their ability to use wiki pages (wikipedia, google docs, other wiki sites) to support a group of pupils creating a wild project on study and employment opportunities, creating a thematically blog on a specific topic, helping pupils to participate in online decision making groups through web 2.0 tools, collaborating with other practitioners at national or international level in order to build a database with relevant information and teaching certain counselling related topics, using content management tools or self-assessment online interest/ skills questionnaires (ie. surveymonkey). The article ends with a set of specific recommendations for stakeholders in the national education system and new research and development areas to be approach forward.

AB The implementation of learning technologies in some subjects in some secondary schools across Australia is still in its early stage. Not surprisingly, the reason is that most, if not all, of the subjects currently being taught do not require the aid of learning technologies. Typical lessons, however, delivered in the class - such as in social sciences, arts and languages are performed by a teacher with the aid of learning technologies. Often, these technologies are suitable for lessons that do not require extensive project development and presentations, such as subjects in Industrial Work (e. g., wood and metal work). In this paper, the author looks at a different approach in achieving learning outcomes focusing on these subjects then introduces learning tools that encourage students to work in teams to assist them in developing and completing their projects. Two learning technologies are developed and tailored, and evaluated for particular classes. The results indicate that these technologies have assisted in achieving elaboration, collaboration, and the intellectual and social development of groups of students working on skill-and time-extensive subjects. The comparative analysis performed in this work is considered the first in recent years. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The performance in Mathematics and Sciences of a large proportion of Moroccan students in middle and high schools has been ranked recently below expectations. The Center of Information Technology Innovation (CITI) for human development at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane (AUI) is investigating how IT-based education could improve both motivation and performance of students in middle and high schools. To demonstrate the positive effect of these ICT resources on the scholastic performance of middle school students, CITI experimented the project in two pilot middle schools. The two schools belong to two different socio-economics environments; one is located in Ifrane (small city) and the other in Fez (large city). In each school, two groups, of 20 students each, have been selected randomly at the beginning of the academic year for the three middle school levels. For each level, one of the groups is the experimental group and the other is the control group. In each the three levels in each middle school, both groups were taught the Biology and Geology course by the same teacher.
   For each academic level, we developed electronic content matching the intended learning objectives of the Biology and Geology course to be taught using information and communication technologies to the experimental groups in both cities. The control groups in each level learn the same course material from the same instructor using the traditional (non ICT) means. It should be noted that each middle has been equipped with an ICT enabled classroom where experimental groups where taught the Biology and Geology course. For each level, both groups were evaluated using the same tests.
   Having designed and run the experiment described above for one semester, we conducted statistical analysis to compare the performance of the experimental and control groups for each level in each middle school. The analysis revealed that the experimental group outperformed the control group for the three levels in the Fez middle school with a 85% confidence. In Ifrane middle school, the performance of the experimental group was superior for the third level but was found to be similar to the control group for the first and second levels with the same confidence level.

AB Purpose - The paper aims to present a conceptual model for networked academic library services in a research-intensive university. It also seeks to focus on the potential challenges that the networked library faces in responding to massive needs of the researchers for digital content in different forms and formats.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author conducted a personal interview (face-to-face, and email communication) with 75 research faculties and postgraduate students in the colleges of business, engineering, IT, and sciences at the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU). The approach to design the conceptual model for the research-oriented library service was based on the feedback and observations of the interviewees on the pattern of query processing, research consultations (e.g. comprehensive, expert, topical search), e-resources coverage, and relevance of the returns to their queries and information needs.
   Findings - The proposed conceptual model demonstrates the virtual reference service, processing of research queries, online information search and retrieval, and data delivery to the researchers within a virtual research environment (VRE) in the UAEU. The study argues that the UAEU library should employ new strategies to meet the arising challenges of digital content and ongoing advances in information and communication technology (ICT), as well as considering how to embed itself within a research-intensive university.
   Research limitations/implications - The personal interview does not claim to be all-inclusive since the research faculties in the humanities and social studies were not reached. The inference of the study is encouraging the directors of the academic and research libraries to consider new models and strategies for providing reliable research-oriented information services for supporting the emerging paradigm of e-research activities.
   Practical implications - The study derived research-oriented service implications for the subject librarians to engage effectively with the research-devoted community either in the physical or in the virtual sphere, i.e. a two-faceted sphere.
   Originality/value - An extensive literature review revealed that there is a lack of scholarly works on research-oriented library services that are provided by the academic libraries at the UAE-based universities. The study is the first in the UAE to provide a broad understanding to an academic library in a research-intensive environment for adjusting its web-based information services. It presents also a suitable approach to embed librarians in the activities of the new paradigms of e-learning and e-science.

AB The changing market conditions relating to globalization processes cause changes in human resource management. Employees wishing to retain their job must be flexible and capable of quickly adapting new technologies, especially information technology. Standard qualifications, especially in the area of advanced technology, are not sufficient any longer, which forces people to use new techniques and technologies of teaching, especially in sciences directly related to information technology. Learning throughout the life has been noticed and appreciated by the European institutions. They have defined eight key competences that are needed by everyone for self-fulfillment and personal development, for active citizenship and full social inclusion and employment. These include, inter alia, mathematical competence. It has been described very accurately described by Mogens Nisse. The idea of mathematical competence exists in the Polish and Czech standards of examination requirements. This article presents doctoral thesis research tasks undertaken at the Faculty of Education, University of Ostrava in the field of development of mathematical competence in students of secondary schools with the use of e-learning. This article presents present condition of the problem and the AIMS study.

AB Confusion between ICT and computer science has lead to an underestimation of the latter in the schools' curricula. Students are involved to use computers rather than to create and produce. Many efforts are done toward inserting computer science in the schools' curricula; However, Computer science should be treated at an equal level with other sciences. The concepts are not more complex than other sciences. Psychologists and pedagogists prove that students are able to learn different concepts according to their intellectual age when these concepts are brought to them with an appropriate methodology.

AB The transfer of teaching activities towards students with the accent of higher rate of self-study by means of modern ICT tools and e-learning is promoted in the current tertiary education. The goal of this paper is to analyze the effect in the newly accredited course Information and Communication Technologies for undergraduate first year students at the Faculty of Economics and Management at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague. There were 760 examination results of students inspected in total. The null hypothesis H0 was stated such as examination results of students with 2/1 contact hours and supported with video tutorials are not different from examination results of students with 2/2 contacts hours and without video tutorials. The null hypothesis was not rejected at the 0.05 significance level. Even if the success rate of students did not decrease significantly, it cannot be said that the use of multimedia e-learning study materials fully covered the deficit of contact hours between students and teacher in the course. The course online study materials are described in the paper with focus on design of video tutorials and self-study learning tools.

AB Purpose - When using information communication technology (ICT) devices it is easy to be trapped by purely the purpose of their design, how they are marketed, product reviews and noting, or even copying, the behaviour of the younger, Net Generation. The purpose of this column is to argue for encouraging all to contribute to deepening our understanding of fully exploiting technology. This includes encouraging people who may be less techno-savvy but with a richer life-world and life-eXperience to share their use of devices such as tablets, and to allow all to benefit from the idiosyncrasy in use that should be aimed at a life-fit with personality, learning style, preferences, etc., and widening information spaces and information horizons.
   Design/methodology/approach - The column is written against the background of research from information behaviour, and the learning sciences (especially andragogics).
   Findings - There are many reasons to explore more than the obvious ways in which ICT devices such as tablets can be used, and for encouraging a spectrum of users to share the idiosyncrasies in their use thereof. Library and information (US) services should move from merely teaching people information literacy and ICT skills to creating grounds for sharing practices and experiences in using devices such as tablets. The focus should move to exploiting the benefit of exploring idiosyncrasies in ICT use and how to encourage people to reflect their life-world and life-experience in their use of ICT devices such as tablets to widen their (and our) information spaces and information horizons.
   Originality/value - Although much has been published on ICT in the library and information science literature and more recently in relation to the Net Generation, the author is not aware of publications exploiting idiosyncrasy and the value that can be added by considering the life-world and life-experience of people in their choices in using ICT devices such as tablets. This paper sets the background for further reflection.

AB Information and communication technology (ICT) has been advocated as a powerful tool for improving health education in low-resource settings. However, few evaluations have been performed of ICT perceptions and user experiences in low-resource settings. During late 2009, an internet-based survey on ICT was administered to students, tutors, and faculty members associated with a Community-Based Education and Service (COBES) program in Uganda. 255 surveys were completed. Response rates varied (students, 188/684, 27.5%; tutors, 14/27, 51.9%; faculty, 53/335, 15.8%). Most respondents owned mobile phones (98%). Students were less likely (p < 0.001) to own laptops (25%) compared to tutors (71%) and faculty (85%). Internet access at rural sites was uncommon; mobile phone coverage was almost universally present. Laptop ownership and internet and mobile phone access was not associated with high valuation of students' COBES experiences. Free text responses found that respondents valued ICT access for research, learning, and communication purposes. In summary, ICT penetration in this population is primarily manifest by extensive mobile phone ownership. Internet access in rural educational sites is still lacking, but students and educators appear eager to utilize this resource if availability improves. ICT may offer a unique opportunity to improve the quality of teaching and learning for COBES participants.

AB The iPad is a very popular touchscreen tablet computer, which was introduced approximately two, two and a half years ago. It runs the MAC operating system making it suitable for different general and special uses. The paper focuses on the fact how the use of iPads can help education, make teaching and learning more efficient. In addition to the technical, infrastructural parameters, which are essential as much as the user's experience and it usability are concerned, the paper provides a few concrete applications as well. Today, the use of iPads is general either in everyday life, or in public education or tertiary education. The author analysis his experiences from the viewpoint of students, but also mentions applications useful for teachers. Students can use iPads with the appropriate applications in any stage of the learning process, e.g. using notes, course materials, schedules and assignments, cooperation, group assignments by collaboration. The paper also describes such solutions or respectively suggestions by means of which the monitoring of shared content and data can be realized by the teacher. A few professional applications (e.g. used by students of medicine, engineering and natural sciences) are also listed.

DE Science education; inquiry activities; wiki; teachers' challenges
AB School has long recognized and accepted Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a means to promote students learning. The wiki presents specific characteristics concerning communication and information publishing and sharing. These characteristics have important potential value that makes it a significant tool to be used by teachers. However, wikis place new challenges related to a different teacher role, a different attitude concerning learning and teaching strategies.
   In order to meet those challenges, teachers have to adapt teaching, by accommodating innovations and by reconciling old and new ideas. However, they can be resistant to introducing changes in their practice. In-service training programmes can play an essential role in overcoming those resistances, by promoting collaboration, supporting the design and implementation of activities involving wikis, facilitating data collection concerning its impacts and reflection about teaching and learning.
   The project 'intTT: An INTegral Teacher Training for developing digital and communicative competences and subject content learning at schools', was funded by Lifelong Learning Programme. Within this project, we developed a training programme with the goal to promote teachers' use of wikis in the classroom. The training programme lasted 50 hour and included two phases. Initially teachers were acquainted with science curriculum and the possibilities it offers for developing inquiry activities using wikis. In this phase, teachers also learnt about wikis use and inquiry activities in science classrooms and they designed, collaboratively, inquiry activities for being explored using a wiki. During the second phase, teachers were involved with activities' implementation in their classrooms, shared their experiences, and reflected, conjointly, on the difficulties, solutions and potentialities envisaged. The present communication aims at describing the challenges that teachers faced and the potentialities that they attribute to the use of wikis.
   Participants were twenty physics and chemistry teachers from ten different schools, nearby Lisbon, who frequented the training programme. The methodology has its roots in qualitative research, with an interpretative orientation. Data was collected by means of interviews and written reflections during and after the programme. Results show that challenges presented to the teachers have different nature. Teachers mostly mention difficulties related with the need to overcome technical limitations, either in school or at home; related to restrictions of available computers and with making Internet connections; related with the time necessary for exploring the activities; related with limitations in the edition of text and pages and with the impossibility of simultaneous publication of the pages, which can lead to information loss. However, they also point several potentialities in wiki use, namely the possibility to diversify teaching strategies, occurring in formal or informal context, to allow a more open and free exploration of scientific contents, the possibility to diversity learning situations, facilitating pupils' development of scientific, communicative and digital competencies.
   It is important now to explore which new competencies should the teachers develop, in order to overcome these challenges related to wikis use and to enact all the potentialities associated with its use in exploring inquiry activities in science classes.

DE Practical teaching; Information and Communication Technologies;
   essential competences; cross-curricular competences
AB Experimental learning becomes very important when teaching experimental sciences, because this methodology allows students to apply theoretical concepts and to see their practical application, which is a part of knowledge construction. Furthermore it promotes independent work and some other competences and/or capacities.
   In the last years universitary teaching experiment a deep transformation due to the adaptation to the guidelines imposed by European Higher Education Area (EHEA) that involved important changes both from methodology and evaluation points of view. These changes include (among others) the implementation of ICT in all fields of the teaching/learning process.
   In this work we redesign traditional experimental practice for the subject Physics 2, of the first course of Chemistry Degree in Universidade da Coruna including methodologies that employ new technologies mentioned to optimize teaching on this subject.
   We use ICT during the whole experimental teaching process. We also analyze the improvements achieved with those changes respecting the previous traditional method and the perception of students about their learning experience.

DE teaching and learning; information and communication
AB University education faces constant demands and new challenges to adequate itself to contemporary socioeconomic, environmental and didactic demands. Searching for alternatives in higher education is compulsory to keep methods updated, allowing the University to fulfil its mission as instrument for teaching and learning (T&L) [1], [2]. Modern education must also take advantage of information and communication technologies (ICT) to achieve its goals on T&L. Such educational resources are becoming gradually incorporated at our University, in order to facilitate daily classroom presentations and to seek for more student-teacher interaction, making easier to understand all kind of themes of interest, without forgetting that different individuals require different didactic approaches. A prerequisite to achieve all these goals is to get qualified teachers familial with ICT. Therefore, usage of ICT as an important resource for education of Chemistry, Pharmacy, Biology and Immunology students is constantly promoted at our University [2]. Several actions have been taken to promote ICT as educative resource in T&L. Our activities have included courses to update teachers in software utilization as support to produce didactic material, Forums that favour contact, communication and exchange of information with experts in various topics, activities that favour team work between our students, creation of new ways to evaluate students at various points of their education, blogs design, and others. By these means, we have attracted many teachers to participate, to expand their competence in ICT, and to apply it to their daily work, adding new methods to the traditional ones and thus enriching their teaching activities.

DE Piloting; Simulation; Training
AB The Simbase project is responsible for the promotion of simulation-based learning through ICT in healthcare centres. ICT are helping us to promote simulation techniques and improve efficiency, quality, reliability and reproducibility of health education. Simbase will improve the implementation of such techniques in health training throughout Europe.
   Simbase gathers health administrative organs, some of the main healthcare centers in Europe and providers of training and technology in health sciences with the aim of promoting the collaboration between them and achieving the promotion of learning techniques based on simulation through ICT and applied to the training in health sciences in Europe.
   To this end, this project has developed pilot courses based on patient simulation that have been carried out in different institutions in four European countries and especially in the early stages of degree, specialization, and finally, continuing training and professional development. Specifically, the four pilotings have been organized in Spain, Portugal, Hungary and Wales. They cover ongoing professional development for nurses, doctors and medical technicians, training of medical students, ongoing training of nurses, and undergraduate and postgraduate training of medical specialists respectively.
   The working method has been to define a questionnaire to help partners develop their driving, leading to a strategy using the impact model assessment identify the skills and competencies to be developed and appropriate technological tools to get the results in each one of the 4 piloting countries. The goals achieved are:
   Test of the model as a strategy design and assessment instrument.
   Definition of patient-simulation training strategies in participating institutions/regions.
   Implementation of priority actions from the said strategies.
   Assessment of actions impact on healthcare systems and their training component.
   As final result of piloting, has been developed a reporting on piloting to determine the validity of the Impact Assessment Model developed in the project;
   Suggest improvements to the model to aid its further development; analyse and assess its application and performance in the real life scenarios experienced during the pilots; and determine its' suitability as a policy implementation tool against a set of pre-established criteria.

AB Since the end of the last millennium there have been tremendous advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs), together with increasing applications in education. Most higher education institutions in the developed world use a learning management system (LMS) as a learning and teaching platform, of which Moodle and Blackboard are well-known examples. In addition to learning how to use an LMS to facilitate learning and teaching, teachers in higher education are also increasingly embracing social media and mobile technologies in an effort to enhance both their teaching and their students' learning. Teachers are, naturally, faced with a variety of choices and issues when it comes to deciding which technologies and mobile devices to adopt.
   This paper will firstly introduce the Horizon Report: 2012 Higher Education Edition and a regional analysis for the New Zealand tertiary education sector. These two reports describe emerging technologies that are most likely to have the biggest impact on society over the next five years and include, inter alia, an overview of the use of mobile apps and tablet computing and their relevance for learning and teaching. Next, a survey of the literature describing the use of the Apple iPad mobile device in learning and teaching will be described. Although the iPad is a relatively new mobile device, the literature shows overwhelming evidence of initial success in learning and teaching. This paper will also include recommendations, based on the successes and challenges reported in the literature, for those teachers who might still be debating whether or not to use the iPad for learning and teaching. Finally, the use of mobile technologies to enhance chemistry teaching and learning, in particular, will be discussed with reference to the use of the iPad2.

AB The aging population requires more education of health habits to get better quality of life and ensure states greater autonomy and less dependence. Some training activities of the Permanent University (University of Alicante) are geared for the student to adopt a lifestyle as healthy as possible and positive health behaviours. Under these premises have been given 3 courses in health sciences: "Biology: cellular basis of disease" (BCBD), "Basic medicine: changes in the human body" (BMCHB) and "Basic medicine: fundamentals of human pathology" (BMFHP). They encouraged the collaborative participation of students to facilitate their learning by involving them in tasks engaging and motivating. In BCBD simple laboratory experiments conducted to learn basics of scientific method. Students understand some basic mechanisms of functioning of the body and the origin of certain diseases through knowledge of the structure and function of cells, tissues and organs. In BMFHP and BMCHB is resorted to teaching techniques of "Problem-Based Learning" (PBL) and "role-playing games" to make it obvious the conclusions of the cases raised and better internalize the lessons learned. In BMCHB students understand the changes due to the natural evolution of the human body throughout life and during the process of becoming ill. In BMFHP on the mechanisms that cause major diseases in the human body and its prevention with healthy habits.

AB Acting as an interface between chemistry, chemical engineering, biology and medicine, biochemists seek to explore and understand the molecular underpinnings of living organisms and of disease. Biochemistry aims to explore and comprehend every aspect of the structure and function of living things. A biochemical approach forms the basis for understanding the function and properties of molecules, cells, tissues and whole organisms, under normal and abnormal conditions and in response to their changing environment. In fact, biochemistry will have a major impact on many of the problems that the mankind has to face today, particularly in the areas of medicine, agriculture and environmental issues. The main objective of the Biochemical degree is to prepare professionals for the pharmaceutical industry, as well as future researchers and teachers. To have success, it is required that students acquire scientific knowledge, but also that they are trained to make use of it appropriately, to think, and to assume responsibilities in the world of drugs.
   Teaching and learning methods are changing considerably because they have to be continuously in response to social and technological advances. Of course, conventional lectures with exercises (calculations) will always exist, although the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is increasing. However practical work in the laboratory (chemical analysis, microbiology, and so on) and in pilot plants (unit operations in chemical engineering, drugs production) is usually required and demanded by the pharmaceutical industry to improve practical knowledge of the graduates and, as a consequence other educational tools such as the Problem Based Learning (PBL) approach and the development of projects prepared by groups of students are becoming important. The main drawback is that this kind of practical teaching is only partial as industry and university do not collaborate as much as it should be, and close relations between industry people and university are essential for the implementation of modern training programs. The actions presented in this article are in the context of the global curriculum of the Biochemistry degree in the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. It presents an analysis of a teaching innovation project, with the students of the third course of this degree, conducted during the academic year 2011-12 in the asignature Biochemistry Engineering Fundamentals; this project includes visits to several pharmaceutical industries from Madrid (Spain).
   University professors, students and professionals from different pharmaceutical industries have worked together to help our students to increase their competitiveness and skilfulness in team work, analysis of real industrial situations, and communication abilities. Also, this project include a new form of teaching the basics operations in biochemical engineering, as filtration, sedimentation, centrifugation, reology, heat transfer, etc. At this point, we would like to present how interactive process visualization software can be used as a common platform to integrate modular teaching. We hypothesize that such an integrated approach will help students to better appreciate the interconnectedness of knowledge acquired in different modules, which in turn will also stimulate their interest in the modules. Following this approach, the students were motivated to develop the forgoing competences and to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the teaching/learning process. The main objective of this experience was to facilitate the students to make a bridge from the theoretical concepts to their application to the reality of the pharmaceutical.

AB The educational method Problem-Based Learning (PBL) has been spread around the world in medicine and health sciences and proved to be a successful education strategy in many different study domains all over the world. Considering the abstraction and difficult understanding of immunological concepts and theory, combination of PBL and Immunological Concepts Teaching (ICT) has been developed in veterinary immunology education in Northwest A&F University for many years. This review described the curriculum design and effect of this approach in this subject. The teaching approach combined PBL and ICT could effectively deepened understanding of immunological concepts and theories, inspired students' learning interest, expand learners' thinking, cultivated their team and cooperation consciousness and improve ability of knowledge acquisition. This review would have important implication for education of veterinary immunology and other veterinary subjects in this university and other colleges or universities all over the world.

AB Because of the potentialities and influences of information communication technologies (ICTs) in facilitating research and instruction in higher education, students' learning products and processes can no longer be restricted to ink on paper. The problem, however, is that ICT use for instructional purposes by staff members at institutions of higher education can be affected by socio-cultural perceptions in different contexts. This study used a convergent parallel mixed method design consisting of a survey followed by interviews to describe the views of a group of Iranian university teachers on the application of ICTs in teaching-learning processes as well as their reported uses of ICTs. 115 randomly selected full-time faculty members in social sciences, engineering, science, and the arts at three major universities in central Iran participated in the survey. Their familiarity with ICTs, their views about the instructional benefits of ICTs in higher education, and their reported uses of ICTs were studied using a researcher-made 20-item Likert-scale questionnaire. A purposive subsample of 15 was also interviewed to offer data on obstacles blocking their ICT use. The analyses of data showed that Iranian university teachers strongly agreed with the educational benefits of ICTs in higher education. In spite of this, they reported infrequent uses of ICTs for research and instruction. Limited resources and facilities, insufficient skills, lack of time for initial preparations, and policy-makers' little support and encouragement were reported as the most serious problems facing university teachers in the use of ICTs. Based on the results and the possible social, cultural, and economic limitations, the article highlights the necessity of promoting staff members' and policy-makers' knowledge of the educational potentials of ICTs as a major priority in in-service trainings.

AB This study is a ten-year critical review of empirical research on the educational applications of Virtual Reality (VR). Results show that although the majority of the 53 reviewed articles refer to science and mathematics, researchers from social sciences also seem to appreciate the educational value of VR and incorporate their learning goals in Educational Virtual Environments (EVEs). Although VR supports multisensory interaction channels, visual representations predominate. Few are the studies that incorporate intuitive interactivity, indicating a research trend in this direction. Few are the settings that use immersive EVEs reporting positive results on users' attitudes and learning outcomes, indicating that there is a need for further research on the capabilities of such systems. Features of VR that contribute to learning such as first order experiences, natural semantics, size, transduction, reification, autonomy and presence are exploited according to the educational context and content. Presence seems to play an important role in learning and it is a subject needing further and intensive studies. Constructivism seems to be the theoretical model the majority of the EVEs are based on. The studies present real world, authentic tasks that enable context and content dependent knowledge construction. They also provide multiple representations of reality by representing the natural complexity of the world. Findings show that collaboration and social negotiation are not only limited to the participants of an EVE, but exist between participants and avatars, offering a new dimension to computer assisted learning. Little can yet be concluded regarding the retention of the knowledge acquired in EVEs. Longitudinal studies are necessary, and we believe that the main outcome of this study is the future research perspectives it brings to light. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This poster was focused in implementing the use of ICT in English learning, especially for sport students. The tool designed was adapted for the English course, during fall semester 2010, in the University of Sports of Tirana. This work was based on developing an application with a variety of modules like: reading and vocabulary, listening activities, writing and games. The aim of this work was to support Albanian sport sciences students in gaining language proficiency through working with this learning tool. The objectives of this work were to develop an English learning tool which enables: 1) lesson support for teachers, 2) student tool for independent work. The students could access this learning tool while sitting in the Foreign Language Laboratory. Students' perception and satisfaction survey was conducted in order to evaluate the ICT resources. A scale with 12 items measured using 5 point Likert Scale was developed based on literature review. This questionnaire was intended to be a piloted one, followed by revised versions in the future, since analysis is an ongoing process. Mann-Whitney U test used to compare "actual" and "preferred" effectiveness and usefulness of ICT in the English course pointed out significant differences. Results of this work showed that teachers must be selective and creative using the ICT to apply various activities in teaching English in order to improve student's experiences in learning. Findings of this paper revealed that English literacy multimedia resources enabled enhancing the language learning and teaching experiences. The tool was a first prototype that can be further extended by improving the topics, including other learning activities and enhancing the user interface.

AB The Portuguese Technological Plan for Education (TPE) was established to modernize schools and to consolidate the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in order to promote the academic success of students and allow schools to be transformed into technological enhanced environments through a significant learning and knowledge building in a participatory, collaborative and sharing logic.
   With this work we aimed to establish dynamical interactions students-content-teacher in order to overcome a diagnosed students' lack of effort towards studying curriculum chemistry content.
   Our methodology design is a non experimental and descriptive one, carried out in a secondary school during a whole school year, in order to answer the question "How to improve the engagement of K-12 students in chemistry classes?". Students, gathered in small groups, were asked to create digital learning resources (DLR) during classes. The teacher assumed the role of the supervisor, coacher and facilitator of every task that had to be taken or chosen by the students. To enhance interaction student-student and student-teacher, a Twitter account and a Ning community were created for the class. Both supported the Social Learning Environment (SLE) that was intended to be created. The data collected - DLR created, participation of each student in the Ning community, teacher observations and students' opinions - led us to satisfactory results in what concerns the goals of this exploratory study.
   We based our research in the following facts: i) the development of a technological basis in education is a social demand and therefore its adoption in a systemic way is no longer a matter of choice; ii) our "digital native" students have different learning styles not considered by traditional instructional practices; iii) SLE promotes and supports collaborative learning through the use of student-created content; iv) involving innovative pedagogical approaches opens up opportunities to engage students in creative learning and can possibly help bridge gaps between innovative and conventional pedagogical approaches and v) the use of well-structured technology, in certain contexts, may have a significant and positive effect on students' achievements.
   SLE has been shaped by experience and this study is about that: web 2.0 tools, social media and student-generated content were used to answer to a combination of curriculum very specific skills and the needs and desires of the students.
   The affordances and constraints of SLE as an open architecture that has potential to facilitate collaborative learning are delineated.
   The methodology followed out allowed an interaction from many to many and an increased students' engagement in the proposed tasks. SLE developed ICT skills and established itself as a cognitive tool: students accessed information about learning content and turned it into knowledge.
   The results seem to demonstrate that TPE, by allowing the ubiquity of computers in schools, let students to be more engaged in working and came out to be a facilitator for integrating ICT in the curriculum.
   Our findings are important for the Portuguese teachers who still withstand, before these "Net Generation" students, to experimenting pedagogical approaches that integrate ICT into real teaching contexts which is now an imperative cause.
   Future work should focus on mechanisms that allow assessment both of the methodology used and the students' generated content in order to improve students' learning in this environment.

DE Emerging technologies; communities of practice; technology professional
   development
ID VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES; KNOWLEDGE
AB Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) as well as modern pedagogical perspectives have created new possibilities to facilitate and support learning in higher education (HE). Emerging technologies bring opportunities to reconsider teaching and learning. New ideas and concepts about the educational use of new technologies transform the roles of teachers. In this context the key question of this study is: whether learning as part of a (virtual) community of practice supports teachers' technology professional development. Different learning alternatives such as distance learning, workplace learning as well as blended forms of learning will enhance lifelong learning which forces a rethinking of traditional forms of education. However, most institutions for education foster just-in-case learning while new technologies foster just-in-time learning. As a result of new learning perspectives and the potential pedagogical benefits of ICTs in educational contexts, teachers have to learn how to integrate new technologies in teaching and learning. It is recommended that teacher professional development should be situated in multiple learning settings in which learning is teacher-centred. Next to classroom settings and cross-institutional learning communities, virtual learning communities (VCoPs) are a significant source for learning. There is an overlap between the educational values of interned-based learning and social theories of learning such as Lave & Wenger's situated learning theory and Wenger's theory of communities of practice. Drawing upon these theories, offers a perspective on social learning that emphasizes social processes within (V)CoPs where community participants engage in collective learning and knowledge creation. The data discussed in this paper have been drawn from a cross institutional setting at Fontys University of Applied Sciences, The Netherlands. The data were collected and analysed according to a qualitative approach. The paper concludes that VCoPs are learning environments since these network-based learning communities push learners to take more control of their learning and provide tasks which are more contextualised and meaningful.

AB The European Higher Education places the student as the essence of the teaching-learning process. This change has been linked to a methodological change that enhances the student's to an active, initiative and critical thinking. In this new setting, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a crucial role, providing new contexts and possibilities for the development of these skills. In order to obtain the maximum amount of feedback, students were required to perform a whole master assessment. We incorporated and examined several factors, including student satisfaction with teachers and contents, level of expectations, level of difficulty when using e-learning tools that have influenced a students' ability to achieve their learning goals and objectives. A total of 12 students coming from different Grades backgrounds participated in the survey. All participants were enrolled in an e-learning environment in which face-to-face instruction occurred only for one week. Results revealed that the interaction of student proactivity factored into the students' utilization of e-learning tools and programs. The increased utilization of e-learning tools subsequently influenced e-learning goal attainment and student outcomes. This survey is one of the first empirical studies of e-learning innovations within the University of Valladolid setting, but our results and conclusions may be applied to other areas. Furthermore, they can drive directions for future research and development of new practical implications. Thus, it is worth sharing the outcomes assessment from the students' perspective, because they are the first and the final targets of the learning process.

AB This study analyzes the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Hydrology practices of the Degree in Forest Engineering and the Degree in Environmental Sciences. A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis was performed to define the best strategy to improve the use of Geographic Information System in these practices. The teachers of the involved subjects identified the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and elaborated the SWOT matrix. A survey was passed to 55 students of the 2010/11 academic year to have into account their opinion. The results advise to adopt a weaknesses and opportunities strategy to overcome the previous students' knowledge of the software, software complexity and access, by taking advantage of free software and students' autonomous work. This strategy will be applied to the practices of the new Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Sciences, which is adapted to the European Higher Education Area.

The central idea of the current e-learning technologies is to provide to the users ability of using and reusing learning objects. These must be compatible with the learning management systems and any other future technology in the education area.
   New informatics technologies like the components-oriented programming or services-oriented architecture enable easily handling and composing of learning objects even by non-specialists, teachers who make up their lessons according to their vision, or students who can practice the knowledge acquired through solving the variants of problems studied.

Thus, the focus of this project is to use homemade e-Learning technologies with social responsibility for the digital inclusion of teachers, especially those who live in the interior of Brazil, with no privileges to participate in presential classes, generally held in the Brazilian great metropolis. Our interest is to create a new paradigm for the usage of electronic media that is not based on a simple copy of the live module used in classrooms, but that takes advantage of the tools and the strength of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

AB The use of ICT in teaching is one of the most accepted resources among the teaching community nowadays. Competence Standards in Information and Comunication Technology Project for teachers of UNESCO proposes the need of adapting new technologies within the sphere of teaching, since current situation is teachers having huge ignorance of using the Information and Comunication Technologies (ICT) tools, in spite of the common acceptance of them as a part of the educational process.
   According to the three focus points considered in the UNESCO project, to achieve teachers proper training in dealing with the integration of ICT in teaching-learning processes, the proposal is to adapt the subject "Complements for disciplinary education in Natural Sciences specialization" to achieve the following three levels: literacy, deepening, and knowledge generation using ICT. All this has been carried out by the study of historical evolution of Natural Science and its adaptation to the social and technological evolution as a transverse resource. First level was achieved from the analysis of students previous smatterings and basic theorical explanations, in addition to a discussion about the use of ICT in teaching. Afterwards, students used ICT through custom-made WebQuests and Wikis, so deepening level is achieved. Thirdly students were urged to make their own WebQuests and Wikis as well as their own virtual classroom, all of that from free topics chosen by them. This is the way in which the next level is achieved, where pupil is able to make his own creations, generating knowledge from the use of ICT.

DE Educational blog; tips for instructors and students; blogging software;
   free educational video; organic chemistry lab; medicinal chemistry lab
AB Bologna is the frame for competence-based learning already established in most European countries. Thus, the new European Higher Education Area is the actual scenario in which the students must assess educational and professional skills, being them the main actors in their own learning process. The competences they should develop along their way through undergraduate studies will confer a cross-curricular leadership, as well as oral and written abilities.
   On the other hand, young people are immersed in a society of information which provided them with tools to face the challenge of attempting to broaden their horizons and become global citizens. In this context, the access to information and communication technologies (ICT), may be one of the main advantages to harness their own skills and enhance their learning process.
   A blog is defined as a type of website or part of a website, and are usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other materials such as graphics or video. They are usually interactive tools and can be distinguished from other static websites. They were firstly implemented by Justin Hall in 1984. Since then, over 156 million public blogs are in existence (data updated 16 February 2011).
   This paper is focused on the construction of a student blog as a learning tool for the laboratory experiments carried out in the Organic and Medicinal Chemistry subjects, at Pharmacy Grade (University of Seville) in order to promote the development of relevant competences. From an educational perspective, the right atmosphere to communicate with other classmates or/ and instructors was achieved. Furthermore, the self-production of laboratory experience-based videos that can be downloaded later from " YouTube" video website, leads to a remarkable input of the student in their own learning procedure, as well as facilitates the task of writing their personal laboratorynotebook.

DE cloud computing; e-education; infrastructure for e-education
AB In this paper, we present a model of cloud computing based infrastructure for e-education in a university level. Model is implemented at Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade. One of the basic problems in developing a model of infrastructure and services for e-education is how to provide scalability and reliability of educational applications and software. The best solution that information and communication technologies offer is based on applying the cloud computing concept.
   Cloud computing is an area of computing where IT scalable capacity is provided in the form of services delivered via the Internet. There are three approaches to deploying cloud computing concepts depending on type of services delivery: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).
   Developed model incorporates learning management system (LMS), services for scientific research (digital library, academic info services, document management system, etc.), decision support system, services for communication and collaboration, etc. Model is implemented in Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) environment powered by Eucalyptus software platform. Described services are implemented within the cloud and tested in regular teaching activities in Department for e-business of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. Analysis of performance has been conducted. Results suggest that the introduction of cloud computing into e-education is feasible and it can greatly improve the efficiency of system and achieve a win-win situation for both students and teachers.

   European project
AB In December 2009 European Schoolnet (EUN, Belgium), Dum zahranicnich sluzeb MSMT (DZS, Czech Republic) and Direccao Geral de Inovacao e Desenvo (DGIDC, Portugal) launched SPICE, a 2-year project funded under the European Commission's Lifelong Learning Programme (DG Education and Culture), with the aim to establish a Science Pedagogy Innovation Centre for Europe.
   The primary objective of this project is to collect, analyze, validate and disseminate innovative pedagogical practice, especially those based on inquiry-based learning whilst enhancing pupil motivation for science studies (at primary/secondary level). SPICE will support this objective by singling out the good practice pedagogies and practices in Maths, Science and Technology, which nowadays are mostly ICT-based, and disseminating them across all Europe. The good practice criteria will allow new projects to have guidelines to ensure their innovation and quality.
   SPICE includes 16 participating countries. A teacher panel, along with a science expert panel, defined good practice experiences. 24 projects were selected and they have been tested in the class. Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Biology are represented in the good practices (GP). They are mainly inspired in IBL (Inquiry Based Learning) and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) are intensively used in their development. Each GP will be tested in more than one country, and each teacher will test 3 projects, and will create a report for each project tested.
   Some examples of projects are "Earth radius (Eratosthenes's method) using Geogebra", "Simulations in Physics class", "Diffusion", "Study of inclined plane efficiency" or "Energy consumption-What can we do?".
   Results of those trials will be shared on the occasion of a Summer school organized by DZS in the Czech Republic.

AB The great difference in our days between the professional profile demanded by companies and that offered by Higher Education institutions requires a deep redesigning of the teaching and learning methods. In this sense, the Competence-Based Learning (CBL) offers a new educational approach centered in the student's acquisition of those key competences essential in their future professional career. Within this map of competences that are articulating the on-going grades, the Capacity of Analysis and Synthesis is one of the most valued generic competence in Science Grades.
   In this article, we present the results obtained when applying a b-learning approach in a chemistry course, with the main aim in mind of developing the competence Capacity of Analysis and Synthesis. This innovative experience was aimed at novice learners in the Energy Engineering degree at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC). In this study, we took all the advantages offered by the Learning Management System (LMS), the Web-CT, which is employed at the URJC, as well as useful free synchronous and asynchronous communication tools currently available on the Internet, apart from additional learning based on lectures and laboratory sessions. This new approach has allowed reaching this initially proposed objective, as well as improving last year academic results. Interestingly, the inspection of the surveys performed for students' satisfaction revealed that the academic results present a remarkable improving in the acquisition level in this competence studied and a high grade of students' satisfaction. In addition, this experience has served to engage students with the subject, as they feel the protagonist of the learning process.

AB Traditionally, innovative learning experiences have commonly consisted of just in-class-based learning, which was usually complemented by additional out-class tasks, where students work a standard activity in groups developing a collaborative learning environment. Nowadays, an online scenario provides different learning settings through network technologies, which support communication and collaboration between instructors and students, overcoming the difficulties generated by rigid and constraint timetables and providing immediate feedback during learning activities. An Asynchronous Learning Network (ALN)-based course enhances educational activities by the combination of self-study with asynchronous interactions among learning entities and creating environments that ultimately provide self-pacing learning, peer-to-peer collaborative scenarios and communications improvements. Therefore, this alternative learning style combines a technology-mediated instruction with a traditional face-to-face learning approach that still retains an important role for the teacher in the learning process. This new learning format is usually referred to as both blended and hybrid learning, and capitalizes on the strengths of both approaches, providing a more effective and efficient learning environment. In this sense, the employment of Wikis in Higher Education has emerged as an excellent online resource to support communication, collaboration and knowledge building capacities, and combines perfectly with the traditional face-to-face contact in a blended learning approach.
   This article describes the use of a Wiki platform as an additional educational tool for first-year learners in a General Chemistry course included in the Biology degree, at the Rey Juan Carlos University. The purpose of this study is to determine if the employment of Wiki Technologies improve collaborative learning, writing skills, consensus building and ultimately increase knowledge management skills. The study has shown that Wikis can be used as convenient pedagogical techniques, which adequately support the learners' collaborative work, apart from engaging students in the learning process. This matter is obviously reflected in the level of students' success at the end of the course. Finally, a satisfaction questionnaire also reveals that students highly value the Wiki flexibility, ease of use as well as estimating this innovative experience more satisfactory than a paper-team assignment.

DE Professional development; technology; action research
AB Over the last two decades, institutions for higher education such as universities and colleges have rapidly expanded and as a result have experienced profound changes in processes of research and organization. However, the rapid expansion and change has fuelled concerns about issues such as educators' technology professional development. Despite the educational value of emerging technologies in schools, the introduction has not yet enjoyed much success. Effective use of information and communication technologies requires a substantial change in pedagogical practice. Traditional training and learning approaches cannot cope with the rising demand on educators to make use of innovative technologies in their teaching. As a result, educational institutions as well as the public are more and more aware of the need for adequate technology professional development. The focus of this paper is to look at action research as a qualitative research methodology for studying technology professional development in HE in order to improve teaching and learning with ICTs at the tertiary level. The data discussed in this paper have been drawn from a cross institutional setting at Fontys University of Applied Sciences, The Netherlands. The data were collected and analysed according to a qualitative approach.

AB One of the main aspects of the new University Grades within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is based on the student personal work, thus Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) help to develop innovative educational programs. The first multidisciplinary on-line Vision Rehabilitation Master of the University of Valladolid was formerly offered in a conventional basis. We used for the first time a Learning Management System (LMS) platform (Moodle), for organizing the knowledge and skill competences designed for multidisciplinary Vision Rehabilitation curricula in Europe. In order to obtain the maximum amount of feedback, students were required to perform a whole master assessment. We incorporated and examined several factors, including student satisfaction with teachers and contents, level of expectations, level of difficulty when using e-learning tools that have influenced a students' ability to achieve their learning goals and objectives. A total of 12 students coming from different Grades backgrounds participated in the survey. All participants were enrolled in an e-learning environment in which face-to-face instruction occurred only for one week. Results revealed that the interaction of student proactivity factored into the students' utilization of e-learning tools and programs. The increased utilization of e-learning tools subsequently influenced e-learning goal attainment and student outcomes. This survey is one of the first empirical studies of e-learning innovations within the University of Valladolid setting, but our results and conclusions may be applied to other areas. Furthermore, they can drive directions for future research and development of new practical implications. Thus, it is worth sharing the outcomes assessment from the students' perspective, because they are the first and the final targets of the learning process.

AB The epidemiological surveillance Bonis system is a computer system designed in the context of a development cooperation project established with Paraguay. The system is operational since last May 2010 in an area of the capital Asuncion, with a positive result in the early detection of contagious diseases such as dengue fever, influenza and others. The success of the impact on the health of the people is due, among other factors, the effective training of staff of epidemiological surveillance. Training has been developed taking into account the following characteristics: a) subject to teach (computer application), b) group to qualify (heterogeneous group that includes epidemiologists, physicians, administrators, health care assistant and general population), c) availability and adequacy of educational media. Training has been conducted in different phases and in different ways. The training team consists of members of the Multimedia-EHU group at the University of the Basque Country and local members of the Institute for Research in Health Sciences; both groups are experienced on face to face and online courses; they have combined their expertise with the potential of ICTs for a training plan to achieve an effective and sustainable formation.

AB Use of computer has enhanced meaningful chemistry learning and developed learning environment. Despite successful computer utilization in classroom, practices are still relatively rare. Few teachers use computer in classroom practice, software often does not fit textbook and the curriculum pattern is poor (Kargiban and Siraj, 2009). Research has shown that chemistry teaching is unpopular and irrelevant in the eyes of students, does not promote higher order cognitive skills, leads to gaps between students wishes and teachers teaching and, most important, is not changing, because teachers are afraid of change and need guidance.
   Given these realities, the Centre for Technology Transfer in the Process Industries from the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest together with SIVECO S.A. and the University POLITEHNICA of Timisoara built a project intended to form and develop the competences of the chemistry teaching staff for using interactive teaching methods. The project aims to introduce ICT tools in the teaching staff professional development and enhance its knowledge in the domain of information and communication technologies through innovative training instruments (e-learning methods). It also creates a collaborative virtual network between the chemistry teachers involved in the project.

AB The paper describes nursing students' opinions on how a mobile application and a web-based reporting tool could act as a supervision method during their clinical training. In a Finnish university of applied sciences we selected software called eTaitava to our piloting project. The aim of the project was to find out about the possibility to establish a new supervising method to teaching by using information and communication technology. Lecturers can use this software in supervising and supporting nursing students' learning process. The empirical study was made by a survey in May 2010. All in all 430 students have used this method and been sent a web-based questionnaire. 112 of them answered the survey, which consisted of 33 questions. According to the findings, two thirds of the students thought that answering almost daily to the questions sent by eTaitava was useful for their learning process, including setting of objectives, daily activities, self-assessment and cognitive reflection. They felt it easy and fast to use by computer, only 9 % used it by mobile phone. The first feedback showed that the information and communication technology-based method is a useful and effective way to supervise learning in nursing education. It is worth developing this idea further.

AB The foreign language teaching using e-learning usually catches on more slowly than the teaching of sciences or technological subjects. We therefore consider the most suitable method of language teaching the blended learning; i.e. the combination of the traditional, face-to-face and on-line teaching.
   For the foreign language teaching we have prepared both the courses using the blended learning and the courses for a distance education. We also have some experience in the teaching of interuniversity studies, but only distance on-line teaching. At our faculty we have now prepared some on-line German and English courses for beginners and for advanced students. We also offer the courses of general, business and banking English and German. The foreign language on-line courses enable to practise individually, for example, some grammar phenomena with the use of a key as a feedback. Moreover, they help to enlarge the vocabulary, give the possibility of using the listening texts and working with a foreign language text. We consider the use of modern technologies very useful. The on-line courses are also useful in the foreign language teaching. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or peer-review under responsibility of the Guest Editor.

AB Information Technology is a combination of communication, reservation, processing and multimedia capabilities. The main role that is played by communication networks is called information and communication technology (or: information technology and communication). Today, information and communication technology (ICT) is of first rate in education systems, but the origin of these saying is based upon scientific finding particularly training sciences, developmental psychology, knowledge and education capability. Under the aegis of IT, the inequities and hand can be reduced and educational systems can be promote knowledge and skill of the learners thereby encouraging and improving creativity, critical thinking and learning how to learn. ICT has an important prominent role in knowledge due to its changeable ability and its capability to making relationship among students. Change-oriented approach believes in change of ICT, has changed the tools and even the policies and educational goals basically and fundamentally. If an appropriate effort is accomplished in order to proper application of IT and making it a base in development programmed can be achieved, this can be considered one of the greatest resource of skillful and proficient human power in IT and can play on important scientific and economic role in the country and in world competitions as well as it provides the real opportunity for fundamental progress and development of the country. If the curricula(or syllabus) is according to real need or real require of the learner, it increases their interest for incremental learning and IT, because of its verity and being benefited from a great deal of information has a property or characteristic to meet different needs of the learner and caused them interested in contents of the curricula. This paper intends to investigate the effect or impact of this phenomenon curricula by stating the role of ICT in educational domain and to provide an integrating and blending programmed for teacher and student and to prepare a field in which the potential of individual capabilities of students and their own and personal experiences could be increased.

DT Article
AB COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is one of the longest-running European instruments supporting cooperation among scientists and researchers across Europe. COST is an intergovernmental framework composed of 35 countries, allowing the coordination of research that is otherwise funded on a European level, through the provision of platforms for European scientists to cooperate on a particular project and exchange expertise. As a precursor of advanced multidisciplinary research, COST contributes to reducing the fragmentation in European research investments and to opening the European Research Area to cooperation worldwide. It anticipates and complements the activities of the EU Framework Programmes, constituting a 'bridge' towards the scientific communities of emerging countries. It also increases the mobility of researchers across Europe, fostering the establishment of scientific excellence (see www.cost.esf.org). COST Foresight 2030 was an initiative designed to explore a broadly-shared vision for a future world beyond 2030, permeated and shaped by the digital revolution. It consisted of a set of events presenting long-term perspectives in the selected fields - Information and Communication Technologies/Computer and Communication Sciences and Technologies (ICT/CCST), Energy, Food Security, Natural Resources Management, Life Enhancement and Society - which play fundamental roles in human life and which are envisaged to be highly influenced by ICT/CCST-enabling technologies. The workshop 'Living the Digital Revolution: The European Society in 2030', the concluding one of the six workshops of the initiative, gathered 20 distinguished scholars and experts from Europe and beyond (AU, NZ, US) for an exploratory brainstorming session. Representing various fields in the social sciences and humanities, such as sociology, education and learning, future studies, law and ethics, economics and business, demography and ICT, the experts focused on the possible trajectories of European societies with regard to the accelerating advancements in ICT/CCST leading up to 2030.

AB This article focuses on understanding teaching activities, especially in the field of health science, as a set of tasks and actions that teachers undertake when transforming scientific knowledge into curriculum contents and actions. There are several ways to address this issue. Some authors identify specific roles and qualities of teachers structured as variables and dimensions. Others use the term competences, applied as skills, aptitudes or abilities to do something very well or duly intervene in a certain matter. The term competence, although not yet clearly defined, is used in this work because it is widely used in Health Sciences education. Some definitions are reviewed. Teacher's competences in the following areas recognized: those related to specific professional skills, in contents organization, in learning skills, in new information and communication technologies, in evaluation and in social and ethical areas of educational practices.

DE E-learning; CSCL; Online Learning; ICT in Education and Activity Theory
AB Many universities both in Malaysia and abroad are enthusiastically embracing some sort of Content Management System or Virtual Learning Environment in teaching and learning, at either or both undergraduate and graduate level. However, online teaching and learning requires a different strategy to traditional classroom teaching and learning, in which the instructor controls all teaching and learning. Simply providing students with online access to learning materials and replicating a classroom model of teacher-centred learning is inadequate. Research advocates online learning move towards a model of student-centred learning in which social collaboration among students is encouraged.
   The study reported in this paper presents the preliminary findings of research investigating the implementation of an online collaborative learning environment in a Malaysian university, which aims to promote student-centred learning through active online participation among Malaysian undergraduate pre-service teachers. The intervention was designed to facilitate group work assignments and to encourage online collaboration among Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics students. The students formed into groups of 4-6 with a total of nine groups involved. The collaborative group work was provided online and the students engaged in online group and inter-group discussions before producing a group report. The discussions had three phases: idea generating, idea linking and intellectual convergence (Harasim, 2004).
   The research used Activity Theory to understand the context and to examine complex technological, pedagogical and social issues in integrating the intervention at the classroom level. Multiple strategies were employed for data collection. An anonymous online questionnaire was distributed at the start and at the end of the course, asking about students' perceptions of learning online through the online collaborative learning environment. Each variable in each theme was presented and grouped under five components of Activity Theory (Tool, Subject, Rule, Community and Division of labour). Focus group interviews were conducted after the students had completed their first group work assignment. Other data were collected from instructors' interviews, online transcripts of students' discussions and students' journals. These data were collected in order to triangulate the findings and to help the researcher to assess the extent to which the intervention was successful in facilitating group work learning experiences.
   The initial findings from the questionnaires point to a positive view of learning online through the online collaborative learning environment for each of the themes. However, students reported problems and difficulties in using e-learning as a learning tool because of technical problems, and Internet availability and capacity in the campus. These problems indirectly affect their motivation to participate in online group work.

DE Bachelor Degree; General Competences; Specific Competences; Physical
   Activity and Sport Sciences; Physical Activity and Sport Biomechanics
AB The Bachelor Degree (BD) in the EEES involves the design of a series of general competences (GC) and specific competences (SC) that are to be developed by students as basic educational objectives of the learning process. The SC of the subjects related with Physical Activity and Sport Biomechanics (PASB) in the BD in Physical Activity and Sport Sciences (PASS) will be designed considering the professional training that the future graduate will develop. Within BD-PASS, module II is oriented to acquiring "Basic training in health sciences" and PASB is a core subject with 6 ECTS. Knowledge of terminology, foundations and biomechanical principles is essential for graduates to improve their professional task in teaching and researching in physical activities, planning and control training, technique performance, prevention of injuries and achieving good health. While students are aware of these principles, they have serious difficulties in their application to basic motor skills and sports techniques acquisition. The purpose of this paper is to develop educational objectives and a programme that would reshape the existing PASB subject in order to facilitate to the student the learning of this discipline. To achieve this purpose, we have considered GC: acquiring concepts, skills and abilities, fitness and values; GC within BD-PASS and SC-PASB subject. Up to now, the PASB subject has been based on mechanical teaching procedures, where the knowledge of these principles is the main objective. However, according to the definition and the essence of Sports Biomechanics, which is the discipline that explains the movement based on mechanical principles considering the peculiarities of human body, we notice that Biomechanics is not Mechanics applied to Sports but a study of Sports Movement that uses the Mechanics. There is a recent discipline that must integrate these concepts using the mechanical principles as a tool, as an instrument of analysis, but keeping the movement as an object of study and not vice versa. This implies a revision in the programs of PASB subject in order to change the mentality of the teacher and to redirect the contents towards this clear objective. Therefore, our purpose is to teach students to acquire the ability to analyse basic motor skills using a methodology based on Qualitative Biomechanical Analysis (QBA). This methodology links the technical or motor skills concepts to the basic concepts of mechanics. Based on this, the purpose is to analyze basic motor skills: walking, running, jumping, throwing, turning, impact tasks, weightlifting and machines working, cycling and swimming activities. The motor skill, analyzed with QBA, classifies the available information in a conceptual map of efficacy indicators. It allows students an innovative assessment of the techniques applied to sports and encourages them to build up their own knowledge. This methodology will be associated to quantitative data selected from the bibliography, which gives the student an access to the scientific field of research. One of the learning tools we suggest is the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), in particular, video clips of the skills as well as the Moodle platform. In conclusion, the proposed method will allow the student to acquire GC-PASS and SC-PASB subjects. This procedure will facilitate the understanding PSAB in order to develop professional skills and research capacities by using theirs own methods of Sports Biomechanics.

DE ICT; education; technology; learning; secondary level school
AB Today no one doubts the important role of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in our society. The use of computers as a tool is one of the basic skills of young students. The use of ICT in education is increasingly important for theory and educational practice.
   In December 2007 published the first results of PISA 2006 (Programme for International Student Assessment). This edition focuses mainly on the level of the students in the sciences. On the provision of ICT, only an indicator appears referring to the average number of computers per student devoted to teaching duties, without distinction as to type of school. Unable to establish comparative data published in previous editions. Spanish average stands at 10 students per computer compared to 3.6 in the UK which gives the best ratio. The average for OECD countries is at 6.7 student / computer. Among European Union countries, the worst ratios (more than 14 students / computer) can be found in Portugal and Poland.
   In the framework of the objectives contained within the i2010 European program, specifically those related to the measurement of the availability of ICT and use of elearning in schools, the European Commission started in January 2006 the study "Indicators for Policy eLeaming 2006.
   The main objectives of the study sponsored by the European Commission are two. First is to update the data on the indicator "number of students per computer with Internet connection" and relate these to other potential indicators of educational use of ICT in compulsory education. Second, is to see what facilities are available and how the teachers used in schools. The study was conducted in 25 member countries of the European Union, Norway and Iceland and the results of this study are made public in August 2006 (European Commission 2006).
   This paper reports primary data analyses of the ICT situation in the secondary schools in Alicante (Spain). The methodology used to collect information is an auto administrate questionnaire relating to the availability, location, internet access and computer's uses. Data were collected with the participation of 67 schools in Alicante province. We propose a number of hypotheses, describe the methodology used, and discuss and analyze the results, and finally we show some conclusions.
   Results show that the technology available appears to be greater in private schools than in public. Regarding the location of the technological means usually found in specific classrooms (computer classrooms). The equipment can be considered quite modern and predominantly Internet connection via ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) access.

DE learning objects; multimedia; design principles; prelaboratory

AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are an increasingly ubiquitous component of everyday life, also having a significant impact on education. The design and application of tools and resources based on ICT have allowed the enhancement and enrichment of learning and teaching experiences. Science education might be considered as an ideal area for using digital learning objects, since technology has always been present in any of the disciplines of this knowledge area. Thus, for example, the introduction of new technologies in science practical work could be actually considered a widespread practice and nowadays it is quite difficult to imagine a science classroom where, somehow, ICT has not been included. But the ways in which educational technology is used in our daily classrooms are diverse and therefore, different models of ICT implementation could be distinguished from the naive model to the radical one.
   Our work may be placed within the evolutionary model, since it intends to enhance on campus teaching by embedding appropriate learning objects (LOs) into suitable b-learning environments and strategies.
   Within this view, the main purpose of our work was to develop digital resources to guide students in their hands-on laboratory activities and engage them in active learning. In order to do so, we have produced a wide range of multimedia materials including pre and post laboratory exercises, taking into consideration the LO design principles.
   The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we briefly review some literature approaches related to LO design and application, focussing on those which offer guidelines for the development of reusable and effective LOs. Secondly, we describe how we have applied these literature contributions to the design of LOs to support laboratory practical work.

AB This paper presents some essential considerations referred to the constructions performed by European teachers in terms of virtual experiments and lesson plans within the framework of a Virtual community collaborative Space for Sciences education. This framework was set up in the context of the Socrates Comenius 2.1 European project: "VccSSe- Virtual Community Collaborating Space for Science Education". In this project, teachers from five European countries (Romania, Poland, Finland, Spain and Greece) participated in blended learning courses aiming their training for the use of Information and Communication Technologies in real teaching and learning practices. Within this framework, on-line training materials and virtual experiments were created and developed. After the end of the designed courses, teachers were asked to form their own virtual experiments and lesson plans and then to implement their products in the classrooms. The analysis of the data shows that teachers who participated in the VccSSe Project encouraged by the aforementioned blended course, expressed a favourable feedback related to the implementation of their own virtual experiments in the teaching activities.

A naturalistic qualitative study was adopted by triangulation method for data collection (mixed-methodology). Observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted by participants to collect data. The obtained data were analyzed using transcriptions to evaluate the current practice in classroom. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyze the quantitative data. About 52% of high school students declared that the computer implemented studying system was a potential method for learning chemistry. Triangulating data showed that the perception of teachers, students, principals and ICT team about the use of computer in teaching process was significantly deferent. The findings revealed that out of the 20 expert respondents, 100% agreed on developing intranet, 95% agreed on establishing inquiry, 90% insisted on use of computer at home and 80% supported constructive ICT coordinator and computer facilities.

   Cyprus
AB In the twenty first century, technology and education becomes the most popular themes that are combined and mentioned together. New innovations in technology influence education because education imparts knowledge and skills to the students which will be used in real life situations. Thus, educational institutions at the first hand and teachers are expected to follow new innovations and integrate them into education in order to help students to keep up with the pace of information and communication technologies.
   Perhaps, with the help of necessary resources, like ICT tools, the opportunity could be given to students to discuss, participate and construct the knowledge themselves in an engaging and entertaining environment. The use of ICT may help teachers to reach many learning objectives in education, support teaching and learning in and outside the classroom. However, many other teachers who are accustomed to traditional pedagogy and do not want to change their teaching strategies may not believe in the benefits of using ICT in education. Moreover, because of many other reasons these new technologies may not be put into practice in teaching and learning environment.
   The main aim of this paper is to explore the reasons for not using ICT innovatively in teaching at secondary school in North Cyprus. The reports are parts of an ongoing doctorate research study in one of the public secondary schools in North Cyprus. The participants were volunteer subject teachers of that particular school. The selection of subjects included High School Entrance Examination subjects; namely, Mathematics, Foreign Languages, Social Sciences, and Science. The study used qualitative research methods to discover the reasons for not using ICT in teaching specific subjects.
   The preliminary findings indicate that some factors that prevent the use of ICT in accordance with the literature are insufficient ICT resources and limited access to available ICT rooms. In addition, the results show that the teachers who use ICT in their teaching believe that they even need more practical training on how to integrate ICT into teaching.

AB The new requirements of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) have led to the implementation of an important change in teaching methodology which has been implemented at the university so far. In this sense, the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) offer a wide range of methodological possibilities which are facilitating the implementation of these new rules of the EHEA. From this area appears what is known as e-learning, a distance learning system that integrates the use of ICT and other educational tools. The special characteristics involving in the subject "Ecophysiology", integrated into the curriculum for the Bachelor of Environmental Science at the University of Granada, convert this subject in a candidate to join to the increasing group of virtual materials of this University. "Ecophysiology" is characterized, for being a highly eligible field for students from other universities, both national and foreign. So, its virtualization would allow the creation of a bilingual Spanish-English platform which would facilitate, first the understanding and learning to students from other countries, and secondly, the access to information for those national students in a language that is the most popular in the scientific world. Another oddity of this subject is the origin of their students in academics terms. Thus, students are from Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, etc., being the background of these students very different. Similarly, the interest in the matter is also different according to the degree that they are studying. Therefore, the virtual structure of matter in a set of basic and complementary modules allow, within limits, to achieve the minimum targets, to study an "Ecophysiology a la carte", owing mainly to the future interests of these students. In this sense, Moodle is the virtual platform that today offers us the possibility of achieving the above objectives. To ensure the success of subject virtualization, the platform will offer a range of resources to students as plan of the course, teaching materials, tasks, readings, links, glossaries, self-assessment questionnaires, bulletin boards, forums, communications service through email, assessment of the subject, etc. The curriculum of the subject, as indicated above, will be distributed as obligatory basic modules and additional modules, among which are able to choose a minimum for passing the subject, being open the possibility of spending the whole of them, depending on the future interests of the students. The virtual tutoring will take place through the forums for the resolution of issues related to the subject and also by e-mail for the resolution of those issues that are personal. Finally, the evaluation will be conducted continuously, with the proposed of a set of activities for that the students can apply the knowledge gained through the material and resources. The activities will be published as progress is made on the contents of the subject, according to the schedule proposed and the modules chosen. The self-assessment exercises will consist in multiple choices, true-false and short answers. Student participation in forums and search for resources (physical or computer) that contribute to the enrichment of the sources of documentation proposed by the teacher will be assessed. There will be a complete logging and tracing the different user access, providing activity reports for each student with details of their activity history.

DE Digital Natives; Generation Y; NetGeneration; Knowledge Society;
   Pedagogy & New Media; eDidactics; eLearning
AB The advent of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) makes clear how the importance of technologies in didactic theory is still an open issue. A number of thinkers, such as Prensky, who introduced the concept of digital natives (2001), or Oblinger&Oblinger (2005), who highlighted the importance of Internet in formal and informal learning processes, showed how, nowadays, ICTs are part of the context and are integrated into so many communication practices of young learners. However, critical voices have suggested that the above sketched approaches are proposing a deterministic view, unjustified generalizations, US-ethnocentrism, and a medication-for-all-ills style in instructional design (Schulmeister, 2008; Bennett et alii, 2008; Pedro, 2006; www.netgenskeptic.com, 2008-10).
   This paper describes and discusses a map of those approaches, including critical voices, and suggests an integrated viewpoint, called L.o.D.E.: Learners of Digital Era. In particular, L.o.D.E. does not take into consideration only the age factor, rather, it stresses new contextual elements, at the same time being open to consider permanent (or "traditional") learning practices/preferences along with the new ones.
   A research project carried out at the Universita della Svizzera italiana (USI) and the University of Applied Sciences of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), investigating learners' practices and preferences when it comes to the use of ICTs in Learning, has confirmed the L.o.D.E. viewpoint, showing in particular that age does not play a major role in shaping practices, and that classroom learning is still among the most preferred strategies to learn.

ID MATTER
AB Multimodality is defined as the use of different modes of communication in creating meaning. In this sense, teaching and learning are multimodal activities. Even though the information society we live in, the use of videos, animations and simulations are already regular expressions, the teaching of science in technological environments and multimodal projects remain awaiting.
   Despite its potential, ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) are often underused in schools that already have them and still have not effectively integrated in the teaching practice. To make these technologies an integral part of science teaching, it is necessary to know the potential benefits of their use in classrooms and outside them, and based on this, teachers can choose the appropriate technological tools to the learning objectives of each topic. By integrating these to the didactic proposals, it will be possible to avoid designing activities that allow the passive use of ICT, as the mere act of observing an animation, as this is an activity with a very low cognitive demand for students.
   In this paper, we present two of the multimodal didactic sequences, which integrate the use of ICT, we are developing in the Faculty of Chemistry of the University of Mexico (UNAM). The subjects we choose to exemplify the work done are fractals and oscillating chemical reactions. These sequences are designed as support materials for teachers and, among others, are intended to present a comprehensive theory, experiment and theoretical model of current scientific issues, looking for relationships between the three levels of scientific explanation: the macro (experiment), the nano (model) and the symbolic.

AB Globalization and current communication technologies demand knowledge to be accessible by all users around the world. Now Audiology is part of it, thanks to the B-learning studies provided by the University of Alicante since 2006.
   The main goals of these studies are the next ones. 1) To improve the advanced complementary quality of training in the Audiology fields. 2) Ongoing training needs in emerging issues or in matters of audiology requiring professional and technological updating according to new health and social requirements. 3) To promote distance education studies by applying the new information and communication technologies of b-learning. 4) To offer a major access opportunity to these studies, especially to people with scanty availability of time or difficulties of displacement. 5) To promote teachers and students exchange between participating Universities and corporate partners. 6) To take part in the educational globalization, in order to improve the relationships between Latin America and Europe.
   These studies are aimed at international professionals related to whatever field of Audiology. The courses target a wide variety of students, most of them coming from Spain, but several others are coming from Latin America countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico or Venezuela). There are graduates of health areas, such as Medical doctor, Otolaryngology, Paediatric, Pharmacology, Psychology, Pedagogy, Speech Therapy, Nursing, Optometry, Orthopaedic and Physical therapy, Hearing aid technician and Audiology. But also graduates from other specialities such as Education (Teachers, Specialists in Hearing and Language), Engineering (Acoustics, Specialists in Sound, Engineer of Telecommunications), Biology, Physical Sciences and Social Work.
   Nine subjects in total are distributed in 50% e-learning and 50% classroom lectures. From the First Edition to the current one, the concept of the course has been modified, offering now a customized program. The courses can be done independently, providing the opportunity to obtain any of the 11 Diplomas or Certificates available, even though the courses are done in different years. For those students who choose courses with classroom practical sessions, an international service is provided, offering the possibility of attending the lessons in Spain (in more than 10 different cities), Argentina, Mexico or Chile.
   Our virtual campus is based on Moodle free Open Source. The tools used for providing the courses are standards, with different text, image or video formats, as well as forum, chat and e-mail. The interaction obtained between students and professors goes beyond the possibilities of classroom courses. The length of the course (13 months) allows the students to share with other students and professors their knowledge, most of the times highly specialized. This experience gained, which is the first one in B-learning in Spain, gave us the possibility of counting on professors from different Universities, Clinics and other professionals within the Audiology field not only from Spain but also from Argentina and Chile. This situation would have never been possible with classic classroom courses.
   Acknowledgements: These General Audiology studies from the University of Alicante (Spain) are endorsed and recognized by the Spanish Association of Audiology (AEDA) (www.aedaweb.com) that is a member of the European Federation of Audiology Societies (EFAS) and the International Society of Audiology (ISA).

AB The School of Chemistry at the University of New South Wales, Australia, is trialing an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) to determine its suitability as a means to capture the research conducted by PhD students. ELN implementation required a partnership to be established between the Library (server space and digital curation), ICT services (technical expertise and IT management), researchers in School of Chemistry (end-users) and the creators of the ELN at Southampton University in the UK. Students who opted to participate in the trial were in the first year of their three-year PhD program, with students in later stages of their PhD (year two and onwards) seeing little value in investing in learning a new work process. The students participating in the trial use an average of five different types of instruments when conducting their experiments and this represents more than five different types of file format. We are now 6 months into the trial and can report that all student participants have found this particular ELN sufficiently flexible to accommodate their experimental work. We are yet to realise the capacity of the ELN as a means to publish data directly from the kinds of instruments used in chemistry research (e.g. mass spectrometers, nuclear magnetic resonance). However, once this has been achieved, we expect to introduce the ELN into undergraduate chemistry curricula.

AB This article provides readers with an insight into the process of teaching/learning the inflectional West Slavic Czech language at the Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove. The contribution is elaborated from several points of view, on the background of commonly featured key teaching/learning theories grouped into the following paradigms of behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism and humanism. Description of the learning/teaching process is accompanied by demonstration of basic principles which were stated by Comenius already in the 17th century but which are incredibly eternal, vivid and efficient up to now. Principles and approaches are illustrated in both face2face classes and in work in a virtual learning space in a sophistically designed Czech Language e-course for Foreigners. The course is highly adaptive it can be modified in accordance with a current situation to foster needs and abilities of participants from various cultural backgrounds. The end of contribution brings findings from three-year experience with implementation of the e-course supporting face2face teaching/learning of Czech language and summarizing remarks on learning languages and teaching techniques. Provided analysis demonstrates how educators can use the learning /teaching overviews and sciences together with in here described e-course to design and run more effective formal and informal learning environments.

DE Computer-based instruction; E-textbook; Media in education
AB Primarily this paper deals with the observations saying that educational sciences are facing an important task to constitute a new school theory enriched by pedagogical analysis of computer-based teaching. The paper underlines that schools have not been prepared to face the challenges of the increasingly fast development of ICTs and new media in education. Massive use of computers and Internet helped develop a new educational technique, this of e-education. The paper discusses flexibility of this form of education as beneficiary to classical forms of education.
   Further on, the paper examines the pedagogical function of e-textbook. The development of e-textbook is often related to programmed textbook. Issues that have been emphasized in the paper are possibilities to reach optimal individualization and to encourage discovery learning based on students' own activities, as well as advantages of this medium use. It has been shown that it is necessary to establish a systematic approach for the conceptual design of an e-text book and also to determine sound pedagogical bases for its didactical design.

AB The computer has become a widely used tool in people's everyday lives as a result of recent developments in the field of information and communication technology (ICT). Various computer programmes have been designed to facilitate human activities. In order to support conventional learning by means of new technologies, user-centred design (UCD) was applied in the development of an interactive edutainment game about the British natural scientist Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution, aimed at primary school children from the ages of 8 to 12. The particular application, "Journey to the Galapagos Islands", is designed to increase the pleasure of learning by integrating educational and entertaining elements in a seamless manner; enabling children to explore the educational content as active participants in a systematic way, due to the concept of guided discovery learning applied to the prototype. This paper describes in detail the results of the four different steps of the iterative user-centred design process. The screen-based prototype was developed with the software Adobe Flash and the programming language ActionScript 3. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with which children interact by means of a computer mouse to solve several educational problems. Finally, this paper documents the evaluation of the prototype with representatives of the defined target age-group in Ireland, drawing important conclusions for further work. These conclusions have been instrumental in the development of a content-specific version to be used as part of a multimedia-based mobile museum within a cooperative project between the University of Applied Sciences (HTW) Berlin and the Jewish Museum Berlin (JMB).

AB This study investigates the perceived barriers to adopting information and communication technologies (ICT) in Omani higher education. One hundred faculty members from four different departments at the College of Applied Sciences in Oman participated in the study. The participants took a survey, which was developed based on the Western literature. Five factors were extracted from the survey: lack of equipment, lack of institutional support, disbelief of ICT benefits, lack of confidence, and lack of time. The findings showed that the faculty members perceived moderate degrees of barriers in applying ICT to their teaching practices. Group differences based on gender, academic rank, and academic field were generally not found except for the interaction effects on the barriers related to lack of equipment, disbelief of ICT benefits, and the overall mean. Male faculty members with less usage of ICT perceived more barriers regarding the lack of computing equipment, disbeliefs of ICT benefits, and the overall barrier than the female counterparts. It is recommended that the survey be further refined to include more subtle and culturally relevant items, larger sample sizes, and more heterogeneous samples to validate and extend the findings. Important implications of this study include a need to provide more institutional support, technical training, and personal time for faculty members to learn and upgrade their knowledge and skills in educational technologies.

AB Increased use of technology for instructional purposes has Caused some debates about ethical and/or moral use of computers. All teachers, as practitioners of ICT in learning settings, must feel responsible for educating students on "what is right and what is wrong?" of computer use. This study aimed to determine prospective teachers' unethical computer using behaviors at a faculty of education in Turkey. The results showed that the participating prospective teachers are sensitive to ethical computer use. However, the general mean of the surveys is above the average by a small degree that makes the participants' judgments of ethical use inconsiderable. it can be concluded that they undermine ethical computer use. Science teachers and computer education teachers' judgments were less ethical than those of classroom teachers and social sciences teachers. The results also revealed that female candidate teachers were more concerned about ethical issues and that prospective teachers who had up to five years of PC experience considered ethical computer use more than those with five years and beyond. After the survey analysis, the study was completed with qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews with nine students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Applications in subject areas; Country-specific developments;

AB This study describes the results of a survey and a description of instructional technologies in place in the social sciences in South African Universities. Lecturers in the social sciences reported a well-established practice of information and communication technologies (ICTs) use for general purposes (although frequent use tended to be for email and searching the Internet). They had a high self-efficacy in terms of using ICTs both generally and for teaching and learning, and a high enthusiasm for the use of ICTs for teaching and learning. Half the lecturers had started using ICTs recently with the introduction of learning management systems (LMSs) whereas the other half had established practices that preceded the main-streaming of LMSs across universities. Only about a quarter of the respondents felt able to develop and update ICTs themselves which indicates that support is a necessary part of teaching with technology. in terms of different types of use the focus was on putting content on the web and course administration. Use of ICTs for teaching of skills (whether information literacy, problem solving or critical thinking) was infrequent. There were different types of ICT use across the different sub-disciplines. Lecturers reported factors which constrained their use of ICTs for teaching and learning, such as inadequate technology, pedagogical issues (e.g. plagiarism), and students opting out of lectures when materials were available online. It is argued that user studies in are relevant to the future delivery of educational material, in terms of removing barriers to use and targeting training and supportive activities.

AB Email is now commonplace in the university environment, but little research has addressed the impact of this technology on the work-life experiences of Teaching Assistants (TAs). These workers are of interest as they are typically responsible for most day-to-day, routine interaction with undergraduates, for ensuring students understand lectures and other course materials, and for assessing student work. In the summer of 2006, we undertook a web-based survey of Teaching Assistants at a major Canadian university. We wanted to examine the impact of and experience with information and communication technologies (ICTs) - in this case, the ubiquitous email. We found that these academic workers made extensive use of email, and that their experiences and attitudes were mixed. While relatively few expressed a desire to completely eliminate email use in their practice, problems such as feeling 'overburdened' by student email were common. Respondents who had set in-person office hours were twice as likely to assert that email increased their workload, that they felt overburdened by student email, and that they preferred not to communicate with students over email. There were also unexpected differences among TAs in the arts/social sciences compared to those in the math/science disciplines. Our data calls into question the largely optimistic orientation common in research reporting at the nexus point of education and ICTs, and suggests that an approach that is both critical and constructive is warranted when thinking about technology and academic work-life.

AB Providing authentic learning experiences by tasks based on real data is expected to result in cognitive as well as motivational benefits for students. Students' abilities to transfer what they have learned to new situations can help teachers to evaluate and improve their instruction. Under these premises, information and communication technologies are an important instrument in education and proved that well used can enhance learning and effectively motivate students towards science subjects. Technology can be used to help meet the challenges of establishing effective learning environments by bringing real-world problems into classrooms. This paper presents an experiment on learning through investigation using a Website and activities under a unifying scientific theme and realistic environment and the reasons why we expect that a broader and more adequate platform can help to bring real science learning inside the future classroom and serve as a motivating aspect to young students to turn sciences, and mathematics in particular, likeable subjects.

AB This paper introduces the electronic Portal, reports on the experiences of its use, shows how it motivates students towards more successful study, encourages lecturers to give better lectures, enhances learning, and so reduces workloads. group of students from the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering in Maribor have used this Portal in their Process Synthesis Course for the last four years. Their responses to e-learning and the Portal were collected by means of a questionnaire The students thought that the Portal was cut effective tool that helped them to improve the quality and efficiency of their studies. They thought a combination of lectures and e-learning to be the most suitable solution for them because it gives a freedom of choice in methods and time devoted to studying. They suggest that this kind of arrangement would be beneficial for use in the future. These statements could motivate college students to choose studies at departments that use modern technologies within the educational process and thus increase the enrolment in those departments. The faculties' responses to using the Portal are also presented. The results of their questionnaires were not as encouraging as the students'. A few lecturers had already used certain functions of the Portal but, in general, they thought that the incorporation of e-learning into the educational process means a heavier workload and is time-consuming. Perhaps the experiences of the lecturer for the Process Synthesis Course, who has been using e-learning for several years, will demonstrate that the incorporation of e-learning into the educational process leads to a heavier workload at the start, but this reduces over time. Perhaps this experience will encourage the faculty to reconsider.

AB Today, the specialists working in a certain field, face different complex problems, many of these requiring the use of computer and software products. The complexity of activities, competitions of all kinds, efficiency requires the use of the best software and hardware products. The explosion of tools and methods offered by information and communication technologies can be easily seen, by computing systems, by peripherical equipments with different functions. There are more and more research, development and innovation programs and results do not delay to appear. At the same time, continuous learning, the use of new knowledge in the activity field must be major goals of every specialist. The real environments of nature are governed by languages. Integration, adaptation and human activity within various environments of nature depend on the degree of knowledge and usage of the languages of these environments. The creation and current usage of computers in life and activity has in fact proven the unlimited creative capacity of mankind. This was possible by reconsidering and by using the concept of languages not only for communication but mainly for knowledge. The latter represents a major requirement of mankind ever since the stage of survival within nature has been deposed. The multitude and complexity of languages show in fact that these efforts, experiments and researches are made in order to process information and knowledge for mankind's well being. The present paper systematically deals with the role of languages in the process of gaining knowledge and offers justification in the spirit of the above-mentioned ideas and comments. It presents a systemic approach on problem solving using demonstrative method and algorithm method. It reveals that the sciences are virtual representations of knowledge. Finally, make a general definition for a language of knowledge.

AB This paper examines findings from two surveys of 10110 university students conducted in South Africa in 2004 and 2007, and explores a theoretical lens for taking the work further. We report on the differences between male and females students' access to and use of ICTs for learning. In particular we note that whilst equal opportunities do largely exist for both genders, there are subtle differences in terms of female students' practical access and sense of personal agency. Findings about use are complicated with male students using ICTs more frequently particularly in the sciences disciplines and for activities such as information seeking and communication (in contrast to research elsewhere). In order to try and better understand our findings and to better focus the qualitative phase of the research currently being undertaken as a result of the findings reported on in this paper, we explore four different theoretical perspectives: Bourdieu's notion of habitus; Feminist Standpoint Theory; Critical Information Systems Theory; and Expectations States Theory. We then suggest using Bourdieu's notion of habitus as our theoretical focus as we believe it offers us the most flexibility whilst enabling a gender focus to be maintained.

AB The study has empirically established that Information and Communication Technology {ICT} as one of the new trends in Educational Sciences could be applied in counselling practice in Anambra State of Nigeria. Results of the study revealed that ICT could be highly applied in the counselling practice. No significant difference was observed in the mean scores of urban and rural based counsellors. In view of the findings, recommendations were proffered. These include a curricula review of computer science courses, intensification of ICT training and skill acquisition to make both staff and students ICT compliants. It was also recommended among others that all institutions of learning should be provided with facilities to enhance access to the internet. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved
